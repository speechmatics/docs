The use of speech-to-text technology in contact center analytics is discussed in a conversation between Ricardo Herreros-Symons and Mariano Tan. They highlight the importance of transcription accuracy for machine learning algorithms to make accurate predictions and the need for a diverse and inclusive voice model. The future of speech recognition in the contact center space is expected to involve a hybrid workforce, with both automation and improving people's lives being in demand. The use of prosodic data points can help detect sarcasm, which is a tricky problem for machine learning algorithms.
