Laura Perez contacts Miranda for help with completing her bookings through the mobile application. Despite refreshing the page and checking her internet connection and payment method, she is unable to complete the booking. Miranda suggests updating the Stay app on her phone, which Laura does, and is then able to successfully book a place. Miranda also offers to send Laura articles on the latest places and promos that Stay offers. Laura expresses gratitude and ends the call.
