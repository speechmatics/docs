1. Speechmatics' ASR Revolution
  - Speechmatics introduced new models named Ursa that focus on accuracy, speed, and efficiency.
  - The new models are optimized for GPUs, which are more powerful and efficient for processing.
  - Ursa has been benchmarked against competitors and found to be the most accurate ASR on the planet, with a 35% improvement for standard and a 22% improvement for enhanced.
  - The models perform better with accents and noise and are three times more efficient than CPU-based models.
  - The latency for real-time transcription has also been improved, with the new models showing little difference in accuracy even at small latencies.
  - Beta customers have used the new models for live captioning at a major car racing event.
