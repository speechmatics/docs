## Project overview

### Installation

```
$ npm i
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### MixPanel setup

To use Mixpanel, set the `MIXPANEL_PROJECT_TOKEN` environment variable when running the app locally (`npm run start`) or building it (`npm run build`). You can store the token in a `.env.local` file. If you're developing and want to use the token from Vercel's preview environment, run `vercel env pull --environment=preview` to populate the file.


NOTE: The `MIXPANEL_PROJECT_TOKEN` env variable containing the **production** token should be available at build time in order to get a build that uses MixPanel suitable for a production deployment.
