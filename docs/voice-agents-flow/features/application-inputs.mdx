# Application Inputs

Voice-enabled applications often need to react to events beyond user speech. For instance:
-	A user pauses for too long, requiring a prompt to keep the conversation going
-	An external notification or system event which must be conveyed during a voice conversation

To handle these scenarios, the application can send an AddInput message to the Flow system. This allows non-verbal or system-driven inputs to be injected into the conversation dynamically.

```json
{
  "message": "AddInput",
  "input": "<string>",                // Required: The input text to be incorporated
  "interrupt_response": "<boolean>",  // Optional: If true, interrupts the current response (default: false)
  "immediate": "<boolean>"            // Optional: If true, processes the input immediately after the current turn ends (default: false)
}
```

## Application Input variables

See [API reference](/api-ref/flow-voice-ai-websocket#addinput) for complete schema.

<SchemaNode schema={omit(flowSpec.components.schemas.AddInput, ["properties.message"])} />
