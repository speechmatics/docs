# Build a conversational AI app with React Native and Flow


Learn how to create a mobile application that integrates Speechmatics Flow service using React Native.
This guide demonstrates how to build the app using the Expo framework, implementing real-time audio communication with Flow's servers.

You can find the complete code on [GitHub <GithubIcon size={16} />](https://github.com/speechmatics/flow-react-native-guide).

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have:

- [Node.js (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed on your system
- Development environment configured for development builds:
  - [Android Development](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?mode=development-build&buildEnv=local&platform=android&device=simulated)
  - [iOS Development](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?mode=development-build&buildEnv=local&platform=ios&device=simulated)

## Project Setup

Start by creating a fresh Expo project:

```sh
npx create-expo-app@latest
```

To remove the example code and start with a clean slate:

```sh
npm run reset-project
```

This command preserves the example files by moving them to an 'app-example' directory while creating a new clean app directory.
You can safely remove the 'app-example' directory if you don't need it for reference.

## Essential Dependencies

Install the following packages to enable Flow integration and audio handling:

```sh
# React version of Flow client
npm i @speechmatics/flow-client-react

# Polyfill for the EventTarget class
npm i event-target-polyfill

# Expo native module to handle audio
npm i @speechmatics/expo-two-way-audio

# Just for the purpose of this example. See comment in the code above `createSpeechmaticsJWT`
npm i @speechmatics/auth
```

:::info
The Flow client uses [EventTarget](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget) which is typically available in browsers but not in react native.
For that reason we've installed the polyfill: [`event-target-polyfill`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/event-target-polyfill).
:::

## Building the User Interface

Let's create a minimal user interface.
Start by clearing the `app/` directory and creating a new `index.tsx` file with a basic UI structure:

<CodeBlock language="tsx" title="app/index.tsx" showLineNumbers>
  {indexStepOne}
</CodeBlock>

The view above will just render a Connect/Disconnect button that won't do anything yet.

Let's run it on the simulator to see how it looks:

```sh
# For iOS simulator
npx expo run ios

# For Android emulator
npx expo run android
```

This will launch the Metro Bundler and show up some options.

:::info
#### Expo Go is not supported
If it shows the following: `Using Expo Go`, **we need to switch to a development build by pressing** <Kbd size="5">s</Kbd>. Then press <Kbd size="5">r</Kbd> to reload the app.
Some features that we are going to include, like the native module for handling audio, don't work properly in Expo Go.
:::

## Implementing Flow Connection

It's time to add some functionality to this example.
We'll start by implementing the connect and disconnect logic.
For that we are going to use the `@speechmatics/flow-client-react` package.

Our `/app/index.tsx` file should now look as follows:

<CodeBlock language="tsx" title="app/index.tsx" showLineNumbers>
  {indexStepTwo}
</CodeBlock>

In the code above, we are injecting the API key from an environment variable.
To make the environment variable available, let's create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following content:

<CodeBlock language="sh" title=".env">
  {"EXPO_PUBLIC_SPEECHMATICS_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE"}
</CodeBlock>

API keys can be obtained from the [Speechmatics Portal](https://portal.speechmatics.com/api-keys)

:::danger
This is just an example app.
In a real app you should obtain the JWT from your server.
`createSpeechmaticsJWT` could be used on a server running JS.
Otherwise, you will expose your API key to the client.
:::

## Audio Integration

The final step is implementing two-way audio communication. This involves three crucial tasks:

1. Microphone input capture in PCM format
2. Speaker output routing for Flow responses
3. Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC) to prevent audio feedback

We'll use the Speechmatics Expo Two Way Audio module to handle these requirements efficiently.

In order to allow microphone access we need to add some configuration to the `app.json` file in the root of our project.
For iOS we add an `infoPlist` entry and for Android a `permissions` entry.

<CodeBlock language="json" title="app.json">
{`
{
    "expo": {
      // ...
      "ios": {
        "infoPlist": {
        "NSMicrophoneUsageDescription": "Allow Speechmatics to access your microphone"
      },
      // ...
      },
      "android": {
        "permissions": ["RECORD_AUDIO", "MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS"],
        // ...
      }
    }
    // ...
}
`}
</CodeBlock>

Now we will update the code to handle these microphone adjustments. Our `/app/index.tsx` file should look as follows:

<CodeBlock language="tsx" title="app/index.tsx" showLineNumbers>
  {indexStepThree}
</CodeBlock>

Since we've introduced some app configuration changes in app.json, let's build the app from scratch (cleaning the `ios` or `android` folders):

```sh
# iOS
npx expo prebuild --clean -p ios
npx expo run:ios

# Android
npx expo prebuild --clean -p android
npx expo run:android
```

Our app can now unmute the microphone to send audio samples to the Flow server. Audio messages received from the Flow server will be played back through the speaker.

:::info
While simulators are great for initial testing, features like Acoustic Echo Cancellation require physical devices for proper functionality.
If you find that the simulator audio support is not working or is not good enough we strongly recommend [testing on physical devices](#testing-on-physical-devices).
:::

## Volume Indicators

To enhance our UI, we'll add volume indicators for both the microphone and speaker, and organize our buttons into a "bottom bar."

**Design Overview**

- Volume Indicators: These will consist of two concentric circles:
  - Outer Circle: Represents the speaker volume.
  - Inner Circle: Represents the microphone volume.
- Animation: The circles will animate to grow or shrink based on the current volume level.

**Implementation Details**

We'll use the `react-native-reanimated` library to handle the animations.
This library is often included by default in Expo apps, but if it's not, you can follow the installation instructions [here](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/get-started/#installation).

To keep things organised, letâ€™s create a new file inside the app folder to house our custom volume indicator component.

<CodeBlock language="tsx" title="app/volume-display.tsx" showLineNumbers>
  {volumeDisplay}
</CodeBlock>

Next, we'll integrate our volume indicator component into the app.

Our `/app/index.tsx` file should look as follows:

<CodeBlock language="tsx" title="app/index.tsx" showLineNumbers>
  {indexStepFour}
</CodeBlock>

We have successfully completed our conversational AI application! You can connect to Flow services and unmute the microphone to start a conversation.

## Testing on Physical Devices

To deploy to real devices, first configure the development environment for using local builds with physical devices:

- [iOS](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?mode=development-build&buildEnv=local&platform=ios&device=physical)
- [Android](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?mode=development-build&buildEnv=local)

Then run the following command:

```sh
# For iOS devices
npx expo run:ios --device --configuration Release

# For Android devices
npx expo run:android --device --variant release
```
