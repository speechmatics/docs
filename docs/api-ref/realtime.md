# Start transcription session (?)

Not sure what to call this page yet, but some thoughts:

- Should highlight that this is the API action to start an RT session
- Should communicate that an RT session is more than just transcription, i.e. can include:
  - translation
  - audio events
  - sentiment
  - etc.
