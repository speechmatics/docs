# Voice agents overview

There are two ways to build voice agents using Speechmatics:

- Integration partners (LiveKit, Pipecat and VAPI): the fastest path to a production voice agent.
- Voice SDK: direct access for custom pipelines or working outside of supported integration platforms.


## Features

Speechmatics provides building blocks you can use through integrations and the Voice SDK.

Key features include:

- **Turn detection**: detect when a speaker has finished talking.
- **Intelligent segmentation**: group partial transcripts into clean, speaker-attributed segments.
- **Diarization**: identify and label different speakers.
- **Speaker focus**: focus on or ignore specific speakers in multi-speaker scenarios.
- **Preset configurations**: start quickly with ready-to-use settings.
- **Intelligent Segmentation**: work with clean, single speaker, segments instead of raw word-level events.

## Integrations

Use an integration to handle audio transport and wiring, so you can focus on your agent logic:

## Voice SDK

Use the Voice SDK to handle turn detection, group transcripts into clean segments, and apply diarization for LLM workflows.

See [Voice SDK](/voice-agents/voice-sdk) for information on getting started, presets, and configuration.
