# Voice agents overview
The Voice SDK builds on our Realtime API to provide features optimized for conversational AI:

- **Intelligent segmentation**: groups words into meaningful speech segments per speaker.
- **Turn detection**: automatically detects when speakers finish talking.
- **Speaker management**: focus on or ignore specific speakers in multi-speaker scenarios.
- **Preset configurations**: offers ready-to-use settings for conversations, note-taking, and captions.
- **Simplified event handling**: delivers clean, structured segments instead of raw word-level events.

### Voice SDK vs Realtime SDK

Use the Voice SDK when:

- Building conversational AI or voice agents
- You need automatic turn detection
- You want speaker-focused transcription
- You need ready-to-use presets for common scenarios

Use the Realtime SDK when:

- You need the raw stream of word-by-word transcription data
- Building custom segmentation logic
- You want fine-grained control over every event
- Processing audio files or custom workflows

## Getting started

### 1. Create an API key

[Create an API key in the portal](https://portal.speechmatics.com/settings/api-keys) to access the Voice SDK. Store your key securely as a managed secret.

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
# Standard installation
pip install speechmatics-voice

# With SMART_TURN (ML-based turn detection)
pip install speechmatics-voice[smart]
```

### 3. Configure 

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key from the portal:

  <TabItem value="python-sdk" label="Python (Voice SDK)">
  <CodeBlock language="python">
    {pythonVoiceQuickstart}
  </CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value='voice-presets' label='Voice SDK presets'>
<CodeBlock language="python">
    {pythonVoicePresets}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value='voice-custom-config' label='Custom config'>
<CodeBlock language="python">
    {pythonVoiceCustomConfig}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
