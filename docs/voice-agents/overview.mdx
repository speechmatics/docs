# Voice agents overview

Our integration partners can be the quickest way to get a production voice agent up and running.

If you’re building it yourself, you can also use our Voice SDK. Integrations are built on top of the Voice SDK, which provides features optimized for conversational AI.

If you’re building an integration and want to work with us, contact support.

## Features

Speechmatics provides building blocks you can use through integrations and the Voice SDK.

It includes:

- **Turn detection**: detect when a speaker has finished talking.
- **Intelligent segmentation**: group partial transcripts into clean, speaker-attributed segments.
- **Diarization**: identify and label different speakers.
- **Speaker focus**: focus on or ignore specific speakers in multi-speaker scenarios.
- **Preset configurations**: start quickly with ready-to-use settings.
- **Structured events**: work with clean segments instead of raw word-level events.

## Integrations

Use an integration to handle audio transport and wiring, so you can focus on your agent logic:

## Voice SDK

Use the Voice SDK to handle turn detection, group transcripts into clean segments, and apply diarization for LLM workflows.

See [Voice SDK](/voice-agents/voice-sdk) for getting started, presets, and configuration.
