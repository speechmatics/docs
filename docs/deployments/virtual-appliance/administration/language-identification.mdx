# Language Identification

By default, Language Identification is disabled, and is currently only available in `Batch` mode. You can enable it using the Management API with

```bash
curl -sSL -u admin:admin -X 'POST' \
  "http://${APPLIANCE_HOST}/v2/management/host/langid" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"max_thread_count": 1, "memory_per_thread": "3Gi"}'
```

- `max_thread_count` is the maximum number of threads the Language Identification will use. When set to 0, Language Identification
is disabled.
Each Language Identification task will use up to one thread, so to allow 2 parallel identification tasks, you should set this value to 2.
- `memory_per_thread` is the memory reserved for each configured thread.
If you set `max_thread_count` to 2 and `memory_per_thread` to 3Gi, 6Gi will be reserved for the Language Identification component.
`memory_per_thread` is optional and if not set will default to 3Gi. When submitting large audio files, you may need to increase the memory
assigned to each thread.


You can learn more about Language Identification in the [SaaS documentation](/speech-to-text/batch/language-identification).
