# Networking

## Network Requirements

:::info **Note**
The Appliance uses k3s default subnets (see: https://docs.k3s.io/cli/server#networking)
:::

- cluster-cidr "10.42.0.0/16"	IPv4/IPv6 network CIDRs to use for pod IPs-
- service-cidr "10.43.0.0/16"	IPv4/IPv6 network CIDRs to use for service IPs

You need to ensure that any network you use does not have an IP address conflict.

## Configure Networking

The Virtual Appliance will attempt to acquire an IP address via DHCP.

If you need to configure a static IP address, you can log into the Appliance and follow the instructions from the [official Ubuntu documentation](https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/net-manual.html.en)

## Firewall Ports

There are several firewall rules that may need to be enabled to ensure the communication can be made to the Virtual Appliance:

| Port/Protocol | Description                                                                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 22/TCP        | SSH access                                                                          |
| 80/TCP        | Used for the Management API to manage the Appliance, and for submitting jobs [^1]   |
| 443/TCP       | Used for HTTPS communication with the above services                                |
| 9000/TCP      | Used for the websocket connection to the realtime transcription service [^2]        |
| 9004/TCP      | Used for the secure websocket connection to the realtime transcription service [^2] |
| 9001/TCP      | Prometheus metrics                                                                  |
| 3100/TCP      | Loki logs endpoint                                                                  |

[^2]: Jobs service only available in `batch` mode.
[^1]: Websocket service only available in `realtime` mode.

## Using Proxies

If the network that you are deploying your Appliance into does not have a direct route to the Internet, you may need to use a proxy server in order to talk to the cloud-based usage reporting service. See the relevant section in [Licensing](/deployments/virtual-appliance/installation/licensing) for details on how to set this up.
