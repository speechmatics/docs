# Monitoring

Appliance resources can be monitored at a system-wide level. Exhaustion of any of the resources can have a negative impact on the speed of the transcription.

The following resources can be monitored:

| Resource ID (rID) | Description                                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| cpu               | Provides the CPU usage across all the vCPU assigned |
| mem               | Provides the total RAM usage of the Appliance       |

Here is an example GET request for the `mem` (RAM) resource:

```bash
curl -sSL -u admin:admin -X 'GET' \
    "http://${APPLIANCE_HOST}/v2/management/meminfo" \
    | jq
```

Here is an example response:

```json
{
  "available_kb": 23412128,
  "total_kb": 32862660,
  "usage_percentage": 14.907302,
  "used_kb": 4898936
}
```

## Prometheus metrics

For advanced monitoring, Prometheus is available on port 9001 in a browser. The default credentials are the same as for the Management API, `admin:admin` unless changed by the user.

```
https://${APPLIANCE_HOST}:9001/graph
```

[Prometheus Querying Basics](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/)

The Prometheus endpoint for clients like Grafana is `https://${APPLIANCE_HOST}:9001/`

## Useful prometheus queries

### Disk space left on the transcription jobs partition

```
# Other useful values are / for the root partition, and /opt/speechmatics/monitoring for the logs partition
node_filesystem_free_bytes{mountpoint=~"/opt/speechmatics/jobs"}
```

### Memory used by individual container images

```
# Autocomplete will offer container names
container_memory_rss{image=~"docker-master.artifacts.speechmatics.io/k8s/batch-jobs-api-v2.*"}
```

### Memory used by the host in total

```
node_memory_MemFree_bytes
```

### Amount of successfully POSTed data over HTTPS

```
traefik_entrypoint_requests_bytes_total{code="201", method="POST", entrypoint="websecure"}
```

# Collecting logs

Logs can be downloaded in a zip file from the Management API via the logs/zip endpoint:

```
curl -sSL -u admin:admin -X 'GET' \
  "http://${APPLIANCE_HOST}/v2/management/logs/zip?limit=1h" \
  -H 'accept: application/zip'
```

A time limit can be set via the `?limit=X` query parameter, for example: 8h5m3s, 8h, 3h30m, 300s. The default unit is seconds if none is supplied, and if the limit is omitted the last hour of logs are returned. Note that the time limit applies to the contents of the logs, as well as which logs are returned, so logs which started before the cut-off point will be truncated and only the tail of the log will be returned in the file.

The zip file will contain logs for all currently running Kubernetes deployments, and in a directory called `extra`, logs collected by the Grafana Loki subsystem, which will include transcription job logs, and logs for Kubernetes pods which have completed.

Requesting too large a time interval may timeout the request, in which case you may need to log onto the box and use `kubectl` commands directly, or use one of the techniques in the next section.

## Advanced log collection

In addition to the logs endpoint in the Management API, which downloads a zip file of recent logs, more fine grained access to logs is available using `logcli`, the command-line client for Loki log aggregation (part of the Grafana ecosystem)

For installation instructions for logcli please see [loki documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/query/logcli/getting-started/)

The Appliance exposes the Loki logs endpoint on port 3100, using an org-id of "fake", which is the Loki standard for a single-tenant installation. As with Prometheus, the default credentials are `admin:admin` unless changed by the user.

[Help for logcli](/deployments/virtual-appliance/administration/logcli-help)

## Query logs for a particular Kubernetes deployment

```bash
export LOKI_ADDR=https://${APPLIANCE_HOST}:3100/
./logcli \
  -o raw \
  --username admin \
  --password admin \
  --tls-skip-verify \
  --org-id=fake query '{instance=~".+:k8sbuffer"}'
```

We use the `-o raw` switch because logs are already in JSON format.

## Query limits

Query results are limited to 1000 entries by default, and `series` and `labels` commands return results within the default period (1 hour). To extend the default period, use the `--from` switch (as shown in an example below).

## Getting the logs for a specific job

For a job with id `1o9islfv29`, first find which series this corresponds to:

```bash
export LOKI_ADDR=https://${APPLIANCE_HOST}:3100/
./logcli \
  -o jsonl \
  --username admin \
  --password admin \
  --tls-skip-verify \
  --org-id=fake series \
  --from="2023-12-13T10:00:00Z" '{}' | grep 1o9islfv29

{instance="default/job-1o9islfv29-h8cw7:blobuploader", job="loki.source.kubernetes.pods"}
{instance="default/job-1o9islfv29-h8cw7:transcriber", job="loki.source.kubernetes.pods"}
{instance="default/job-1o9islfv29-h8cw7:preprocessor", job="loki.source.kubernetes.pods"}

```

Three series are listed because a transcription job (corresponding to a Kubernetes job) has three containers in its Kubernetes pod. You can request one at once (usually the transcriber log is most useful), or all three by using a `*` wildcard, like this: `'{instance=~"default/job-1o9islfv29-h8cw7:.*"}'`. Note that using a wildcard will merge the logs.

```bash
export LOKI_ADDR=https://${APPLIANCE_HOST}:3100/
./logcli \
  -o raw \
  --username admin \
  --password admin \
  --tls-skip-verify \
  --org-id=fake query --from="2023-12-13T10:00:00Z" '{instance="default/job-1o9islfv29-h8cw7:transcriber"}'

{"jobid": "1o9islfv29", "Request-ID": "477c5bc3ad4027d973b59f2f9ec4276e", "msg": "Shutdown complete", "level": "INFO", "time": "2024-01-05T11:33:19.733285"}
{"msg": "Eats client process finished", "level": "INFO", "time": "2024-01-05T11:33:19.717805"}
{"msg": "Transcribed 4 seconds of speech", "level": "INFO", "time": "2024-01-05T11:33:19.503377"}
{"jobid": "1o9islfv29", "Request-ID": "477c5bc3ad4027d973b59f2f9ec4276e", "msg": "RTF: 3.291123", "level": "INFO", "time": "2024-01-05T11:33:19.502920"}
...
```

The transcriber log can also be requested more simply via the jobs API itself.

If you have issues with HTTP notifications being sent, examine the log of the `blobuploader` which is the final stage of the transcription process. If there are problems with audio format or pulling audio from a remote source, examine the `preprocessor` logs.

## Useful Loki queries

### Batch

*Job RTF (Real Time Factor)*

Provides a measure of job processing time relative to the length of the audio file, useful for measuring/optimising throughput.

```'{job="loki.source.kubernetes.pods", instance!="monitoring/loki-0:loki"} |= `COMPLETED_JOB` | unpack | __error__=``'```

Returns a list of json log lines containing the field `rtf` where each line represents a single completed job.

### Realtime

*Final Lag*

Provides a measure of lag between audio sent and audio transcribed, useful for measuring/optimising throughput.

```'{job="loki.source.kubernetes.pods", instance=~"default/sm-proxy-a.*"} |= `connection usage stats` | unpack'```

Returns a list of json log lines containing the field `g.final_lag` where each line represents the final lag for a minutes usage of a given session.

*Partial Lag*

Provides a measure of lag between audio sent and partial transcriptions, useful for measuring/optimising throughput.

```'{job="loki.source.kubernetes.pods", instance=~"default/sm-proxy-a.*"} |= `connection usage stats` | unpack'```

Returns a list of json log lines containing the field `g.partial_lag` where each line represents the partial lag for a minutes usage of a given session.
