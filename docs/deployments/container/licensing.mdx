# Licensing

**To** run our containers you need a license. To get a license you need to speak to [Support](https://support.speechmatics.com).

The license is easy to pass into the container deployment either as a file or a environment variable. Licensing does not require network access and works in offline deployments.

## License Structure

The contents of the file received should look similar to this:

```json
{
  "contractid": 1,
  "creationdate": "2020-03-24 17:43:35",
  "customer": "Speechmatics",
  "id": "c18a4eb990b143agadeb384cbj7b04c3",
  "is_trial": true,
  "metadata": {
    "key_pair_id": 1,
    "request": {
      "customer": "Speechmatics",
      "features": ["MAPBA", "LANY"],
      "isTrial": true,
      "notValidAfter": "2021-01-01",
      "validFrom": "2020-01-01"
    }
  },
  "signedclaimstoken": "exampleClaimsToken"
}
```

The `validFrom` and `notValidAfter` keys in the license file specify the start and end dates for the validity of your license. The license is valid from 00:00 UTC on the start date to 00:00 UTC on the expiry date. After the expiry date, the Container will continue to run but will not transcribe audio. You should apply for a new license before this happens.

## Volume Mapping in a License File

The license file should be mapped to the path `/license.json` within the Container.

For example:

<CodeBlock>
  {`docker run -v ./my_license.json:/license.json batch-asr-transcriber-en:${smVariables.latestContainerVersion}
`}
</CodeBlock>

## Setting the License with an Environment Variable

For example, copy the `signedclaimstoken` value from the license file and set the `LICENSE_TOKEN` environment variable:

<CodeBlock>
  {`docker run -e LICENSE_TOKEN=exampleClaimsToken batch-asr-transcriber-en:${smVariables.latestContainerVersion}`}
</CodeBlock>

There should be no reason to do this, but if both a volume-mapped file and an environment variable are provided simultaneously then the volume-mapped file will be ignored.
