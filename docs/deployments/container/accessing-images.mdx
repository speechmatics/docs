# Accessing Images

The Speechmatics Docker images are obtained from the Speechmatics Docker Repository. If you do not have a Speechmatics Docker Repository account or have lost your details, please reach out to [Support](https://support.speechmatics.com).

The latest information about the Containers can be found in the knowledge base section of the [Support Portal](https://support.speechmatics.com). If a support account is not available or the _Containers_ section is not visible in the Support Portal, please reach out to [Support](https://support.speechmatics.com) for help.

## Prerequisites

- Speechmatics Docker repository credentials – speak to [Support](https://support.speechmatics.com) to get these
- Language Code – the ISO language code (for example `fr` for French)
- `LICENSE_TOKEN` - The value of the signed claims token which is used to validate the license file. This is required to run the Container. Speechmatics Support will provide this within the license file generated for each customer
- `TAG` – which is used to identify the image version

## Docker Repository Login

Using the credentials supplied by Speechmatics, login to our Docker repository:

```bash
docker login https://speechmaticspublic.azurecr.io
```

You will be prompted for your username and password that was provided to you. If successful, you will see the response:

```
Login Succeeded
```

If unsuccessful, please verify your credentials and URL. If problems persist, please contact Speechmatics Support.

:::info
Speechmatics require all customers to cache a copy of the Docker image(s) within their own environment. Once the first version of the container is pulled from the Speechmatics Software Repository, please re-host in a private container registry instead and reference your personal registry in your deployments.

## Pulling Core Speech CPU Images

Each supported language pack comes as a different Docker image, so the process will need to be repeated for each language pack required using the relevant language code.

<CodeBlock>
  {`# pulling Batch Global English (en) with the ${smVariables.latestContainerVersion} tag:
docker pull speechmaticspublic.azurecr.io/batch-asr-transcriber-en:${smVariables.latestContainerVersion}
\0
# pulling the Batch Spanish (es) model with the ${smVariables.latestContainerVersion} tag:
docker pull speechmaticspublic.azurecr.io/batch-asr-transcriber-es:${smVariables.latestContainerVersion}
\0
# pulling Real-Time Global English (en) with the ${smVariables.latestContainerVersion} tag:
docker pull speechmaticspublic.azurecr.io/rt-asr-transcriber-en:${smVariables.latestContainerVersion}`}
</CodeBlock>
