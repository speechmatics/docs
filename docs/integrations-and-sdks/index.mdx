## Benefits
Speechmatics is built for real-world application, handling the nuances of natural human conversation.

**Unmatched Accuracy**: 
- The most accurate real-time sst engine, delivering final transcripts in less than 1s without compromising accuracy. 
- This balance of speed and precision is critical for voice agents, allowing them to respond naturally to users while keeping the conversation flow intact.

**Noise Robustness using VAD**: 
- Voice Activity Detection to filter out background noise (cafes, call centers, wind), ensuring your agent doesn't hallucinate words due to static.

**Global Accent & Dialect Support**: 
- Speechmatics STT understands diverse accents without needing regional configuration

**Low Latency for Real-Time Transcription**: 
- Speechmatics STT delivers transcripts in milliseconds, preventing the "awkward silence" that breaks immersion in voice bots.

**Contextual Precision**: 
- Features like Custom Dictionary allow you to teach the AI brand names, acronyms, and domain-specific jargon (e.g., medical or legal terms) to ensure 100% recognition rates on high-value keywords.
