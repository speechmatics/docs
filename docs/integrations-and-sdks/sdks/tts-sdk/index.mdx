## Text to speech SDKs

The Speechmatics text-to-speech SDK provides a simple and efficient way to integrate a TTS service into applications. 
It offers a fast way to convert text to speech and stream the audio to an output device or file, in a voice of your choosing.

### Experiment with the TTS SDK available in Python:

<Grid columns={{initial: "1"}} gap="3">
  <LinkCard
    title= "TTS SDK (Python)"
    icon={<FileAudio/>}
    href="https://github.com/speechmatics/speechmatics-python-sdk/tree/main/sdk/tts"
  />
</Grid>

Additional TTS SDKs in other programming languages are coming soon!
