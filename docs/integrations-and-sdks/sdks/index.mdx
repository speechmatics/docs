- [Realtime processing](#realtime-processing): Stream audio from an input device or file and receive instant updates of the transcription as it happens
- [Batch processing](#batch-processing): Submit an audio file and receive a complete text transcription once the processing is finished
- [Text to speech](#text-to-speech): Convert text to speech and stream the audio to an output device or file
