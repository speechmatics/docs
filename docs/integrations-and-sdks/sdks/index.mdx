Speechmatics SDKs provide a simple and efficient way to integrate an STT or TTS service into applications. 
They offer a range of features, including speaker diarization, turn detection, noise robustness, and global accent support. 

### Developer Quickstart

import { LinkCard } from "@site/src/theme/LinkCard";
import { Flex, Grid } from "@radix-ui/themes";
import {

} from "lucide-react";

Use speech to text to transcribe using one of the modes -
- Real-time stt processing: Stream audio from an input device or file and receive instant updates of the transcription as it happens
- Batch stt processing: Submit an audio file and receive a complete text transcription once the processing is finished

Or,
- Convert text to speech and stream the audio to an output device or file

Or, 
- Build conversational AI voice agents with Flow SDK
