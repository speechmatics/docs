# Vapi

Vapi offers native integration with Speechmatics for real-time, highly accurate speech-to-text in AI voice agents. This integration is designed to handle real-world conversation complexities like background noise, diverse accents, and multiple speakers. 

Vapi is perfect for:

- **Customer Service & Contact Centers**: Automating customer interactions with AI agents that can accurately understand and respond to diverse accents, background noise, and industry-specific jargon, leading to better customer experiences and call routing.
- **Healthcare & Medical**: Building agents for tasks like appointment booking, patient triage, and clinical note-taking (ambient AI) where precise transcription of medical terminology is critical for compliance and efficiency.
- **Multi-Lingual Communication**: Developing global voice agents that can operate in over 55 languages, automatically detecting the language spoken and providing accurate transcription and translation.
- **Meeting & Interview Platforms**: Creating AI assistants that can accurately transcribe multi-speaker conversations in real-time and identify who said what, providing full context for downstream tools and automated summaries.
- **Educational Tools**: Implementing interactive study partners that can quiz students, elaborate on topics, and provide immediate feedback through natural voice interactions. 

## Features

- **Native Availability**: Speechmatics is a natively available transcriber option within the Vapi platform, simplifying the setup process for developers.
- **High Accuracy & Low Latency**: The integration provides an accurate and low-latency input layer, crucial for natural, real-time conversations with AI agents.
- **Speaker Diarization**: Speechmatics is the only transcriber on Vapi that provides speaker diarization, which identifies and labels who said what in multi-speaker scenarios.
- **Flexible Deployment**: Speechmatics STT is available in Vapi's managed platform.

## Quickstart

### Requirements
- Vapi >= 1.2
- Speechmatics Account (https://portal.speechmatics.com)

### UI Integration

The Vapi UI provides a simple way to integrate Speechmatics STT into your voice AI agent. 

1. Navigate to assistants tab in the Vapi dashboard.
2. Choose an existing assistant or create a new one.
3. Access the transcriber tab or scroll down to the transcriber module settings.
4. Select Speechmatics in the provider dropdown menu.

### Python SDK 
```python
from vapi import Vapi

client = Vapi(token="YOUR_VAPI_API_KEY")

assistant = client.assistants.create(
    name="Support Agent",
    transcriber={
        "provider": "speechmatics",
        "model": "enhanced",
        "language": "en"
    },
)
```

### Best Practices

- **Operating Point** Select the enhanced model for the best accuracy in real-time voice agents.
- **Region** Choose the region closest to your users to optimize latency.
- **Custom Vocabulary** Use this feature to add key terms (e.g., product names) and leverage the sounds-like option for tricky pronunciations.
