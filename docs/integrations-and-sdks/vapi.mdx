# Vapi integration

Vapi offers native integration with Speechmatics for real-time, highly accurate speech-to-text in AI voice agents. 
This integration is designed for rapid deployment and handles real-world conversation complexities, such as background noise, diverse accents, and multiple speakers, with no code required. 

Vapi is perfect for:

- **Customer service & contact centers**: Automating customer interactions with AI agents that can accurately understand and respond to diverse accents, background noise, and industry-specific jargon, leading to better customer experiences and call routing.
- **Healthcare & medical**: Building agents for tasks like appointment booking, patient triage, and clinical note-taking (ambient AI) where precise transcription of medical terminology is critical for compliance and efficiency.
- **Multi-lingual communication**: Developing global voice agents that can operate in over 55 languages, automatically detecting the language spoken and providing accurate transcription and translation.
- **Meeting & interview platforms**: Creating AI assistants that can accurately transcribe multi-speaker conversations in real-time and identify who said what, providing full context for downstream tools and automated summaries.
- **Educational tools**: Implementing interactive study partners that can quiz students, elaborate on topics, and provide immediate feedback through natural voice interactions. 

## Features

- **Native availability and flexible deployment**: Speechmatics is embedded within the Vapi platform, simplifying the setup process.
- **High accuracy & low latency**: The Speechmatics integration provides an accurate and low-latency input layer, crucial for natural conversations with AI agents.
- **Speaker diarization**: Speechmatics is the only transcriber on Vapi that provides speaker diarization, which identifies and labels who said what in multi-speaker scenarios.

## Quickstart

### Requirements
[VAPI Account](https://vapi.ai)
[VAPI Private Key](https://dashboard.vapi.ai)
[Speechmatics Account](https://portal.speechmatics.com) 
[Speechmatics API Key](https://portal.speechmatics.com/settings/api-keys): Add to VAPI Dashboard under Provider Keys

### UI Integration

The Vapi UI provides a simple way to integrate Speechmatics STT into your voice AI agent. 

1. Navigate to assistants tab in the Vapi dashboard.
2. Choose an existing assistant or create a new one.
3. Access the transcriber tab or scroll down to the transcriber module settings.
4. Select Speechmatics in the provider dropdown menu, and add your Speechmatics API key, which can be generated in the [Portal](https://portal.speechmatics.com/settings/api-keys).

### Usage 
```python
import os
from vapi import Vapi
from vapi.types import SpeechmaticsTranscriber

client = Vapi(token=os.environ["VAPI_API_KEY"])

assistant = client.assistants.create(
    name="Speechmatics Quickstart",
    transcriber=SpeechmaticsTranscriber(
        provider="speechmatics",
        language="en",
    ),
)

print(f"Assistant ID: {assistant.id}")
```

### Best practices

- **Operating point**: Select the enhanced model for the best accuracy in real-time voice agents.
- **Region**: Choose the region closest to optimize latency.
- **Custom vocabulary**: add key terms (e.g., product names, medical terminology) and leverage the "sounds like" option for tricky pronunciations.
