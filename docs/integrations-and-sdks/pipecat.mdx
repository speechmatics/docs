# Pipecat integration

Pipecat is an open-source framework for building voice agents. When Speechmatics STT is integrated with Pipecat, you can build real-time voice and multimodal conversational agent specifically tailored to your needs. 

Pipecat is perfect for:

- **Voice AI**: Voice assistants, chatbots, and IVR systems
- **Transcription**: Realtime transcription of live events or media
- **Accessibility applications**: Screen readers and assistive technologies
- **Content creation**: Podcasts, dubbing, audiobooks, and voice-overs
- **Media production**: News broadcasts and automated announcements

## Features

- **Realtime transcription**: low-latency speech-to-text for responsive agents
- **Speaker diarization**: track who’s speaking in multi-participant sessions
- **Turn detection**: capture natural speech boundaries automatically
- **Noise robustness**: maintain accuracy in challenging environments
- **Custom vocabularies**: boost recognition for domain-specific terms
- **Flexible deployment**: use on-device, cloud, or hybrid Pipecat setups
## Quickstart

### Requirements
- Python 3.10 or later
- uv package manager installed
- Pipecat >= 1.2
- Speechmatics account. You can create one [here](https://portal.speechmatics.com). 
- Speechmatics API key. You can generate one in the [Portal](https://portal.speechmatics.com/settings/api-keys).

#### Installation
```python
pip install "pipecat-ai[speechmatics]"
```
### Usage
Set the environment variable SPEECHMATICS_API_KEY to your Speechmatics API key.
```bash
export SPEECHMATICS_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

```python
import asyncio
import os

from pipecat.services.speechmatics import SpeechmaticsSTTService


async def main():
    stt = SpeechmaticsSTTService(
        api_key=os.environ["SPEECHMATICS_API_KEY"],
    )

    async def audio_stream():
        # Replace with your real audio source.
        yield from [b"fake_audio_chunk_1", b"fake_audio_chunk_2"]

    async for result in stt.transcribe(audio_stream()):
        speaker = f"Speaker {result.speaker}" if result.speaker else "Unknown"
        print(f"{speaker}: {result.text}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
