# LiveKit integration

LiveKit Agents is a framework for building real-time, voice-enabled AI applications that connect with LiveKit rooms.
With the Speechmatics STT plugin, you enable your voice agent to transcribe live audio in real-time, along with speaker diarization, turn detection and noise robustness. 

LiveKit integrations are perfect for:

- **Voice AI**: voice assistants, chatbots, and IVR systems
- **Transcription**: live events or recordings
- **Accessibility**: screen readers and assistive technologies, in-app help widgets
- **Media**: news broadcasts, automated announcements

## Features 

- **Realtime transcription**: instant, accurate speech-to-text
- **Speaker diarization**: identify and separate multiple speakers automatically
- **Turn detection**: detect natural speech boundaries and pauses
- **Noise robustness**: maintain accuracy in challenging environments
- **Global language support**: works with diverse accents and dialects
- **Partial results**: receive interim transcriptions for faster response times
- **High accuracy**: industry-leading word recognition for natural conversations

## Quickstart

### Requirements

- LiveKit >= 1.2
- [Speechmatics account](https://portal.speechmatics.com). 
- Speechmatics API key. You can generate one in the [Portal](https://portal.speechmatics.com/settings/api-keys).

### Installation

```python
uv add "livekit-agents[speechmatics]~=1.2"
```

### Usage

```python
import os
import asyncio

from livekit.agents import AgentSession, cli
from livekit.plugins import speechmatics

async def run_agent(room):
    session = AgentSession(
        stt=speechmatics.STT(
            api_key=os.environ["SPEECHMATICS_API_KEY"],
        ),
    )
    await session.join(room)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    cli.run_app(run_agent)
```
