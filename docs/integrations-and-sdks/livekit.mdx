# LiveKit Agents

LiveKit Agents is a framework for building real-time, voice-enabled AI applications that connect with LiveKit rooms.
With the Speechmatics STT plugin, you enable your voice agent to transcribe live audio in real-time, along with speaker diarization, turn detection and noise robustness. 

LiveKit Agents is perfect for:

- **Voice AI**: Voice assistants, chatbots, and IVR systems
- **Translation**: Real-time transcription of live events or recordings
- **Accessibility applications**: Screen readers and assistive technologies, in-app help widgets
- **Media production**: News broadcasts, automated announcements

## Features 

Using Speechmatics STT you can:
- Obtain partial and final results, 
- Incorporate speaker diarization, 
- Turn detection (end of utterance detection)
- Noise robustness using VAD
- Global accent & dialect support
- Low latency for real-time transcription
- Contextual precision

## Quickstart

This section includes a basic example and some reference material. 
For more detailed examples, please see the [Speechmatics Academy](https://github.com/speechmatics/speechmatics-academy).

### Requirements

- LiveKit >= 1.2
- Speechmatics Account (https://portal.speechmatics.com)

### Installation

Install the plugin from PyPI:

```python
uv add "livekit-agents[speechmatics]~=1.2"
```
### Authentication

The Speechmatics STT plugin requires an API key. You can generate your API key in the [Speechmatics Portal](https://portal.speechmatics.com/settings/api-keys).
Set the environment variable `SPEECHMATICS_API_KEY` in your .env file.

```bash
export SPEECHMATICS_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

### Usage

Use the Speechmatics STT in an AgentSession or as a standalone transcription service. 

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from livekit.agents import AgentSession, cli
from livekit.plugins import speechmatics

# Load API keys from .env file
load_dotenv()

# Initialize the agent with Speechmatics STT
async def run_agent(room):
    session = AgentSession(
        stt=speechmatics.STT(
            enable_diarization=True,
            end_of_utterance_silence_trigger=0.3
        )
    )
    
    # Process incoming audio
    @session.on("transcription_received")
    async def on_transcription(event):
        print(f"Speaker {event.speaker}: {event.text}")

    await session.start(room)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    cli.run_app(run_agent)
```
