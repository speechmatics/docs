# Speech to text overview


Use speech to text to transcribe using one of the modes:
- [Realtime processing](#realtime-processing): Stream audio from an input device or file and receive instant updates of the transcription as it happens
- [Batch processing](#batch-processing): Submit an audio file and receive a complete text transcription once the processing is finished

## Deployments

Speechmatics provides flexible deployment options tailored to your requirements. You can host the platform in your own environment, use our managed service, or choose a hybrid approach.

For deploying our API in your environment, [contact sales](https://www.speechmatics.com/speak-to-sales), or see our [on-prem documentation](/deployments).

## Realtime processing

Turn live audio into accurate transcripts — instantly.

The [Speechmatics Realtime speech to text API](/api-ref/realtime-transcription-websocket) converts spoken audio into text with low latency and high accuracy.

:::info
- Use when speed matters
- Transcribe live broadcasts or events
- Caption webinars, meetings, or podcasts in real time
- Power voice assistants or AI agents with live input
- Monitor contact center calls as they happen
- Build accessibility features like live captions
:::

## Batch processing

Create transcripts from pre-recorded audio or video.

The [Speechmatics batch speech to text API](/api-ref/batch/create-a-new-job) processes pre-recorded files asynchronously, returning highly accurate transcripts in a range of formats.

:::info
- Transcribe recorded meetings or interviews
- Caption on-demand videos and podcasts
- Generate searchable transcripts for media archives
- Process customer service recordings for compliance or insights
- Automate subtitles across large video libraries

### What is a job?

Behind the scenes, each transcription request is handled as a job — a self-contained unit representing a single transcription task.

A job includes:
- The audio or video file to be transcribed
- Configuration settings (e.g. language, formatting, diarization)
- Metadata and status tracking
- The resulting transcript(s)

You submit a job to the API, monitor its progress, and retrieve results once it's complete. Jobs can be created via direct upload or by referencing a URL.

Both modes support the same input/output formats and features — only the underlying model differs.
