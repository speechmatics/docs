# Speech to text overview

Learn how to turn audio into text.

Use speech to text to transcribe using one of the modes:
- [Real-time processing](/speech-to-text/real-time): Stream audio from an input device or file and receive instant updates of the transcription as it happens
- [Batch processing](/speech-to-text/batch): Submit an audio file and receive a complete text transcription once the processing is finished
