# Formatting

Control how numbers, punctuation, and special text appear in your transcripts.

## Numeral formatting

Speechmatics automatically converts spoken numbers, dates, currencies, and other entities into properly formatted text. This makes transcripts more readable without losing timing information.

For example, spoken words like "nineteen ninety nine" become "1999" in the output.

### Enable entity metadata

To include detailed information about entities in your JSON output, add this to your configuration:

```json
{
  "type": "transcription",
  "transcription_config": {
    "language": "en",
    "enable_entities": true
  }
}
```

By default, `enable_entities` is `false`. When enabled, entity metadata appears only in JSON output (SRT and TXT formats remain unchanged).

The JSON output will include:

- A new `type` field with value `entity` for formatted numeric entities
- Full written form in the `content` section, including any spaces or symbols
- An `entity_class` field describing how the entity was formatted
- Start and end times spanning all words in the entity
- Two additional representations:
  - `spoken_form`: Original words as spoken, with individual timing and confidence
  - `written_form`: Formatted words separated individually

### Entity classes

The system applies different formatting rules based on the type of entity detected. The following classes are available:

| Entity class | Description | Spoken example | Written example |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| alphanum | Alphanumeric sequences (3+ characters) | "a z triple seven five four" | AZ77754 |
| cardinal | Whole numbers (in English, numbers ≤10 remain as words) | "nineteen" | 19 |
| decimal | Numbers with decimal point | "eighteen point one two" | 18.12 |
| fraction | Fractions (complex ones use n/d format) | "three sixteenths" | 3/16 |
| ordinal | Position numbers with suffix | "forty second" | 42nd |
| money | Currency values with symbol | "twenty dollars" | $20 |
| percentage | Percentages with % symbol | "two hundred percent" | 200% |
| date | Calendar dates and years | "fifteenth of January twenty twenty two" | 15th of January 2022 |
| time | Clock times with separators | "eleven forty a m" | 11:40 a.m. |
| span | Ranges (x to y format) | "one hundred to two hundred million pounds" | 100 to £200 million |
| credit card | Payment card number sequences | "one one one one..." | 1111 2222 3333 4444 |
| telephone | Phone number formatting | "five five five..." | (555) 429-2228 |
| electronic | Email and web addresses | "bob at speechmatics dot com" | bob@speechmatics.com |
| measurement | Units with abbreviations | "ten kilometers per second" | 10 km/s |

:::warning
The system chooses entity classes based on context, so occasionally a value might be classified differently than expected. For example, "2001" could be a "cardinal" number or a "date".
:::

### Language-specific formatting

Each language follows its own conventions for:

- Thousand separators
- Decimal separators
- Currency symbol position

Examples:
- **English**: Uses commas for thousands (20,000), decimal points (10.5), and places currency symbols before values ($10)
- **German**: Uses periods for thousands (20.000), commas for decimals (10,5), and places currency symbols after values with a non-breaking space (10 $)
- **French**: Uses non-breaking spaces for thousands (20 000), commas for decimals (10,5), and places currency symbols after values with a non-breaking space (10 $)

### Supported languages

Entity metadata is available in these languages:

- Cantonese
- Chinese Mandarin (Simplified and Traditional)
- Dutch
- English
- French
- German
- Hindi
- Italian
- Japanese
- Norwegian
- Portuguese
- Russian
- Spanish
- Swedish

### Example output

Here's an example of a transcript with `enable_entities` set to `true`:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "alternatives": [
        {
          "confidence": 0.99,
          "content": "17th of January 2022",
          "language": "en",
          "speaker": "UU"
        }
      ],
      "end_time": 3.14,
      "entity_class": "date",
      "spoken_form": [
        {
          "alternatives": [
            {
              "confidence": 1.0,
              "content": "seventeenth",
              "language": "en",
              "speaker": "UU"
            }
          ],
          "end_time": 1.41,
          "start_time": 0.72,
          "type": "word"
        },
        // Additional spoken words omitted for brevity
      ],
      "start_time": 0.72,
      "type": "entity",
      "written_form": [
        {
          "alternatives": [
            {
              "confidence": 0.99,
              "content": "17th",
              "language": "en",
              "speaker": "UU"
            }
          ],
          "end_time": 1.33,
          "start_time": 0.72,
          "type": "word"
        },
        // Additional written words omitted for brevity
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

When `enable_entities` is `false`, the words appear individually in the output.

## Punctuation settings

All Speechmatics language packs support punctuation to improve transcript readability.

### Supported punctuation marks

Each language supports specific punctuation marks:

| Language | Supported marks | End-of-sentence marks | Notes |
|----------|----------------|---------------------|-------|
| Cantonese, Mandarin | ， 。 ？ ！ 、 | 。 ？ ！ | Full-width punctuation |
| Japanese | 。 、 | 。 | Full-width punctuation |
| Hindi | । ? , ! | । ? ! | |
| All other languages | . , ! ? | . ! ? | |

### Customizing punctuation

You can control which punctuation marks appear in your transcripts using the `punctuation_overrides` setting:

```json
"transcription_config": {
   "language": "en",
   "punctuation_overrides": {
      "permitted_marks": [".", ","],
      "sensitivity": 0.4
   }
}
```

This configuration:
- Allows only periods and commas (no question or exclamation marks)
- Sets punctuation sensitivity to 0.4 (lower than the default 0.5)

The `sensitivity` parameter accepts values from 0 to 1. Higher values produce more punctuation in the output.

:::warning
Disabling punctuation may slightly reduce speaker diarization accuracy. See the [speaker diarization and punctuation](/speech-to-text/output-enhancements/diarization#speaker-diarization-and-punctuation) section for details.
:::

## Output formatting options

Speechmatics provides several ways to customize your transcript formatting.

### Output locale

To ensure consistent spelling throughout your transcript, specify an output locale:

```json
{
  "type": "transcription",
  "transcription_config": {
    "language": "en",
    "output_locale": "en-GB"
  }
}
```

:::tip
**Recommended for English transcription**. Without a specified locale, spelling may be inconsistent within the same transcript.
:::

Available English locales:
- British English (`en-GB`)
- US English (`en-US`)
- Australian English (`en-AU`)

Chinese Mandarin locales:
- Simplified Mandarin (`cmn-Hans`, default)
- Traditional Mandarin (`cmn-Hant`)

### Profanity tagging

You can tag profanities to identify or censor offensive language in your workflow. Profanity tagging is available for:
- English (`en`)
- Italian (`it`)
- Spanish (`es`)

Tagged profanities appear in the transcript with the `profanity` tag:

```json
"results": [
  {
    "alternatives": [
      {
        "confidence": 1.0,
        "content": "$PROFANITY",
        "language": "en",
        "tags": [
          "profanity"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "end_time": 18.03,
    "start_time": 17.61,
    "type": "word"
  }
]
```

For other languages, consider using [word replacement](#word-replacement) to identify profanities.

### Disfluencies

Disfluencies are hesitation sounds like "um", "uh", and "hmm". In English, these are automatically tagged with `disfluency`:

```json
"results": [
  {
    "alternatives": [
      {
        "confidence": 1.0,
        "content": "hmm",
        "language": "en",
        "tags": [
          "disfluency"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "end_time": 18.03,
    "start_time": 17.61,
    "type": "word"
  }
]
```

<details data-accent-color="gray">
  <summary>Full list of tagged disfluencies</summary>
<CodeBlock>
{`huh

err

mm
um
uh

uh-uh
mhm
a-ha

huh-uh
m-hm
uggh
ugh
ughh
uhh
uhhm
uhm
uhmm
umm
uuh
uuhh
uum`}
</CodeBlock>
</details>

#### Removing disfluencies

You can automatically remove disfluencies from your transcript:

```json
"transcription_config": {
  "language": "en",
  "transcript_filtering_config": {
    "remove_disfluencies": true
  }
}
```

This simplifies client-side processing by removing hesitation sounds and properly adjusting capitalization and spacing. For example:

Without disfluency removal:
> Um, what would you like, hmm?

With disfluency removal:
> What would you like?

This feature is available for English only. The default setting is `"remove_disfluencies": false`.

### Word replacement

Word replacement lets you substitute specific words or patterns in the transcript after processing:

```json
"transcription_config": {
  "language": "en",
  "transcript_filtering_config": {
    "replacements": [
      {"from": "foo", "to": "bar"},
      {"from": "heavy", "to": "light"}
    ]
  }
}
```

Common uses for word replacement:
- Censoring profanities in languages without built-in support
- Masking sensitive information (card numbers, personal data)
- Standardizing terminology or brand names
- Fixing known issues with particular words

Word replacement is case-sensitive and applied after transcription is complete. For example, "Foo" would not be replaced by "bar" in the example above.

Note: For adding new vocabulary, use the [Custom Dictionary](/speech-to-text/features/custom-dictionary) feature instead.

#### Using regular expressions

You can use regular expressions (ECMAScript format) in the `from` field by adding forward-slash delimiters:

```javascript
// Replace both "Hello" and "hello" with "goodbye"
{"from": "/^[hH]ello$/", "to": "goodbye"}

// Add brackets around "cheese" while preserving the original word
{"from": "/(cheese)/", "to": "[$1]"}
```

Word replacement rules:
1. Plain word replacements are processed first
2. If no match is found, regex replacements are tried in the order listed
3. Once a word matches a replacement, no further replacements are applied to it
4. Regex replacements are global (all matches are replaced)
5. Malformed regex patterns will cause the transcription to fail with an error
