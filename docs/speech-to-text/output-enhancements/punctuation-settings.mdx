# Punctuation Settings

All Speechmatics language packs support punctuation settings to improve the readability of your transcripts.

## Supported Punctuation

The following punctuation marks are supported for each language:

| Language(s)         | Supported Punctuation | End of Sentence (EOS) | Comment                          |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Cantonese, Mandarin | ， 。 ？ ！ 、         | 。 ？ ！              | Full-width punctuation supported |
| Japanese            | 。 、                 | 。                    | Full-width punctuation supported |
| Hindi               | । ? , !               | । ? !                 |                                  |
| All Other Languages | . , ! ?               |. ! ?                  |                                  |

If you do not want to see any of the supported punctuation marks in the output, then you can explicitly control this through the `punctuation_overrides` settings. You can also optionally change the amount of punctuation by setting the `sensitivity` to a value between 0 and 1. Higher values will produce more punctuation. The default is 0.5. For example:

```json
"transcription_config": {
   "language": "en",
   "punctuation_overrides": {
      "permitted_marks":[ ".", "," ],
      "sensitivity": 0.4
   }
}
```

This will exclude exclamation and question marks from the returned transcript and reduce the chance of punctuation.

All Speechmatics output formats support advanced punctuation. JSON output places punctuation marks in the results list marked with a `type` of `"punctuation"`.

:::warning
Disabling punctuation may slightly harm the accuracy of Speaker Diarization. Please see the [Speaker Diarization and Punctuation](/speech-to-text/output-enhancements/diarization#speaker-diarization-and-punctuation) section in the docs for more information.
