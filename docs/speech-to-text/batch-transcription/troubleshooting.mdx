# Troubleshooting

## Basics

:::info
For troubleshooting On-Prem deployments, please refer to the [On-Prem documentation](/deployments/container/cpu-speech-to-text-container).
:::

If you see errors when you submit a job or perform any other actions, we advise you to check a few things before raising a Support ticket:

1. API endpoint
2. Language code
3. API key expiration

## 401 Authorization Required

A 401 Authorization Required error will be returned as HTML and means that an API Key has not been provided or the wrong API endpoint has been chosen.

Your API key is linked to a specific region and must be used with any interaction with the Speechmatics API to authenticate to the service.

For example:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>401 Authorization Required</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <center>
      <h1>401 Authorization Required</h1>
    </center>
    <hr />
    <center>nginx</center>
  </body>
</html>
```

## 403 Entitlement Check Failed

The below error indicates that the API Key being used to submit the job has either expired or does not have a requested feature in the config file that has been submitted:

```json
{
  "code": 403,
  "detail": "Entitlement check failed",
  "error": "Forbidden"
}
```

## 429 Rate Limited Requests

A 429 error means that the request has been rate limited by our API. This situation could be avoided by adding a 1-second delay between requests of the same type, e.g., adding a 1-second delay between `GET /v2/jobs/{job_id}` requests.

## 503 Service Unavailable

In the rare event of a 503 error, the request can be retried immediately. If the issue persists, please [Raise an Incident](#raising-an-incident) with the Support team.

## Terminating jobs
If you want to terminate a job that is in progress, you can use the [Delete endpoint](/jobsapi#tag/jobs/paths/~1jobs~1%7Bjobid%7D/delete) with the `force` parameter. This could be helpful if job seems stuck, too long running, or the output is no longer needed.


## Raising an Incident

If you need to raise a Support ticket, then please reach out to [Support](https://support.speechmatics.com).

As part of good practice always provide:

- A thorough description of the error you encountered
- Any relevant Job or Session IDs
- The configuration information you used to submit the job request

Please provide a Job ID where possible. A response for a successful job should look like this:

```
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Length: 20
Content-Type: application/json
Request-Id: df6ec500191bf2c02ee42d519fbea34f
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=15724800; includeSubDomains
X-Azure-Ref: 01mDmXAAAAABUtz6ZgS7QRI2F3f5B+19wTE9OMjFFREdFMDMxMgBhN2JjOWQ4MC02YjBiLTQ1NWEtYjE3MS01NGJkZmNiYWE0YTk=
Date: Thu, 23 May 2019 08:59:08 GMT

{"id":"z2jfp1jwu1"}
```

Here, the Job ID is `z2jfp1jwu1`. The Request-Id is `df6ec500191bf2c02ee42d519fbea34f`

If you submitted a job, but did not receive a Job ID as expected please provide any Request-Id, and X-Azure-Ref headers that may have been returned to you in the HTTP response. An error will be reported as a 4XX or 5XX status code; instead of the job ID an error message will be returned. The Request-Id can be included in the ticket to support to help Support engineers troubleshoot the problem. Here's an example:

```
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Content-Length: 179
Content-Type: text/html
Request-Id: 00adae505fa8cb7c7f24c6bf52c60048
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=15724800; includeSubDomains
X-Azure-Ref: 0LWLmXAAAAAB2mDIdAu7kSZ/kKszi7eH4TE9OMjFFREdFMDMwOQBhN2JjOWQ4MC02YjBiLTQ1NWEtYjE3MS01NGJkZmNiYWE0YTk=
Date: Thu, 23 May 2019 09:04:49 GMT

<html>
<head><title>401 Authorization Required</title></head>
<body>
<center><h1>401 Authorization Required</h1></center>
<hr><center>nginx/1.15.8</center>
</body>
</html>
```

Please note that in the future the response for HTTP 401 and 429 responses will be content-type `application/json` rather than `text/html`.
This is how an HTTP 401 request will now look:

```
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Content-Length: 179
Content-Type: application/json
Request-Id: 00adae505fa8cb7c7f24c6bf52c60048
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=15724800; includeSubDomains
X-Azure-Ref: 0LWLmXAAAAAB2mDIdAu7kSZ/kKszi7eH4TE9OMjFFREdFMDMwOQBhN2JjOWQ4MC02YjBiLTQ1NWEtYjE3MS01NGJkZmNiYWE0YTk=
Date: Thu, 23 May 2019 09:04:49 GMT

{"code": 401, "error": "Unauthorized"}
```

Here, the Request-Id is `00adae505fa8cb7c7f24c6bf52c60048`. Please note the response here is in JSON format and is no longer an HTTP response.

## Status Page

Sometimes an issue you have could be caused by a problem on the server side. You can keep track of our service health status updates on our [Status Page](https://status.speechmatics.com/).
