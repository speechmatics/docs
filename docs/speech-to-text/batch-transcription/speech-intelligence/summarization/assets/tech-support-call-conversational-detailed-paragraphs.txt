Laura Perez called the customer service of Stay to report that she was unable to complete her bookings through the mobile application. She had already refreshed the application several times, checked her internet connection, and payment method, but still encountered the same issue. She also mentioned that the application goes back to the main page every time she tries to browse. The customer service representative, Miranda, asked if the application showed any error message, but Laura said it did not. Miranda then asked if Laura had updated the software to its latest version, to which Laura replied that she was not aware of any update. Miranda advised Laura to update the Stay app on her phone by going to the app store and clicking the update button beside the Stay icon. After updating the app, Laura was able to book a place successfully.

Miranda also asked Laura if it was okay to send her articles on her email to keep her updated on the latest places and promos that Stay offers. Laura agreed and thanked Miranda for her help.
