# Turn detection 

Use the end of utterance feature to help with turn detection in real-time conversational scenarios.

## Use cases

**Voice AI & conversational systems**: Enable voice assistants and chatbots to detect when the user has finished speaking, allowing the system to respond promptly without awkward delays.

**Real-time translation**: Critical for live interpretation services where translations need to be delivered as soon as the speaker completes their thought, maintaining the flow of conversation.

**Dictation & transcription**: Helps dictation software determine when users have completed their input, improving speed of final transcription and user experience.


## End of utterance

End of utterance detection is a feature that allows you to detect when a person has finished speaking. This is useful for voice AI, translation, and dictation use cases.
End of utterance uses server-side word timings to detect periods without speech. The moment a word is detected on the server, a countdown begins.
If a new word is detected, the countdown restarts.
If the configured interval passes without another word being detected, an end of utterance is triggered.
When this happens, the server sends a [final transcript](/speech-to-text/realtime/quickstart#final-transcripts) message to the client, followed by an extra `EndOfUtterance` message.

To enable end of utterance detection, include the following in the [StartRecognition](/api-ref/realtime-transcription-websocket#startrecognition) message:

```json
{
  "type": "transcription",
  "transcription_config": {
    "conversation_config": {
        "end_of_utterance_silence_trigger": 0.5
    },
    "language": "en",
  }
}
```
* `end_of_utterance_silence_trigger` (Number): Allowed between 0 and 2 seconds. Setting to 0 seconds disables detection. This is the number of seconds of non-speech (silence) to wait before an end of utterance is identified.

**Notes** 

- We recommend 0.5-0.8 seconds for most voice AI applications. Longer values (0.8-1.2s) may be better for dictation applications.
- Keep the `end_of_utterance_silence_trigger` lower than the max_delay value.
- `EndOfUtterance` messages are only sent after some speech is recognised and duplicate `EndOfUtterance` messages will never be sent for the same period of silence. 
- The `EndOfUtterance` message is not related to any specific individual identified by [Diarization](/speech-to-text/features/diarization) and will not contain speaker information.

### Example message

```json
{
  "message": "EndOfUtterance",
  "format": "2.9",
  "metadata": {
    "start_time": 1.07,
    "end_time": 1.07
  }
}
```

## Custom turn detection

You can use our `ForceEndOfUtterance` message to manually trigger an end of utterance detection at any point in the conversation. This allows you to integrate your own end of turn detection model with our ASR.

The `ForceEndOfUtterance` message is sent to the server to trigger an end of utterance detection:

```json
{
  "message": "ForceEndOfUtterance"
}
```

When this message is received, the server will send a `Final` transcript message, followed by an extra `EndOfUtterance` message.

## Semantic turn detection

While silence-based end of utterance is enough for many use cases, it is often improved by combining it with the context of the conversation. This is known as 'semantic turn detection'. You can try semantic turn detection right away with our free [Flow service demo](https://www.speechmatics.com/flow)! 

{/* TODO add anchor here when flow docs are merged */}
Semantic turn detection comes [already included](/voice-agents-flow) in Flow to provide the best experience for your users. You can also check out our [semantic turn detection "how to"](https://blog.speechmatics.com/semantic-turn-detection) guide for more details on how to implement this in your own application.
