# Realtime speaker identification

## Enrollment

To generate identifiers for a desired speaker, run a [speaker diarization](../features/diarization.mdx#diarization-modes) enabled transcription on an audio sample where the speaker is ideally speaking alone.
You can request the identifiers back from the engine by sending a `GetSpeakers` request.

By default, the engine returns identifiers created up to the time of the request, but you can also wait until the end of the stream by setting the optional `final` flag in the `GetSpeakers` request (recommended for enrollment):

```json
{
  "message": "GetSpeakers",
  "final": true
}
```

- final: false (default) — returns identifiers generated up to the point of the request. To avoid empty results, wait until the server has issued at least one `AddTranscript` message before sending the request.
- final: true — waits until the end of the stream and returns identifiers based on all audio.

When the request is processed, the server replies with a `SpeakersResult` message that contains the identifiers for each diarized speaker:

```json
{
  "message": "SpeakersResult",
  "speakers": [
    {"label": "S1", "speaker_identifiers": ["<id1>"]},
    {"label": "S2", "speaker_identifiers": ["<id2>"]}
  ]
}
```

## Identification

Once you have generated speaker identifiers, you can provide them in your next transcription job to identify and tag known speakers. This is done through the new `speakers` option in the speaker diarization configuration. A maximum of 50 speaker identifiers across all speakers can be configured per session.

All other [speaker diarization options](realtime_diarization.mdx#configuration) remain supported. Among them, the `max_speakers` parameter continues to apply only to generic (non-enrolled) speakers — for example, if it’s set to 10 and 10 speakers are enrolled, the system can still add up to 10 additional generic speakers. The `speakers_sensitivity` parameter can also be used to adjust how strongly the system prefers enrolled speakers over detecting new generic ones, where lower values make it more likely to match existing enrolled speakers.

An example configuration is shown below:

```json
{
  "type": "transcription",
  "transcription_config": {
    "language": "en",
    "diarization": "speaker",
    "speaker_diarization_config": {
      // highlight-start
      "speakers": [
        {"label": "Alice", "speaker_identifiers": ["<alice_id1>", "<alice_id2>"]},
        {"label": "Bob", "speaker_identifiers": ["<bob_id1>"]}
      ]
      // highlight-end
    }
  }
}
```

With the config above, transcript segments should be tagged with `"Alice"` and `"Bob"` whenever these speakers are detected, whereas any other speakers should be tagged with the internal labels:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "alternatives": [
        {
          "confidence": 1.0,
          "content": "Hello",
          "language": "en",
          // highlight-start
          "speaker": "Alice"
          // highlight-end
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "alternatives": [
        {
          "confidence": 1.0,
          "content": "Hi",
          "language": "en",
          // highlight-start
          "speaker": "S1"
          // highlight-end
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "alternatives": [
        {
          "confidence": 1.0,
          "content": "Nice",
          "language": "en",
          // highlight-start
          "speaker": "Bob"
          // highlight-end
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
