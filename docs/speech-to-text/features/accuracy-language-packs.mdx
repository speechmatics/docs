# Accuracy and Language

For more information on the full range of language packs offered by Speechmatics, please refer to the guide on [Supported Language Packs](/speech-to-text/languages).

## Accuracy

Speechmatics offers two operating points for transcription:

- Enhanced - Optimized for the highest accuracy possible.
- Standard - (Default) Optimized for fast Batch turnaround time. 

Note that when transcribing in real-time, latency for both Standard and Enhanced operating points is controlled using the `max_delay` config option described [here](/speech-to-text/realtime/output#latency).

**Note** that your choice of Operating Point will impact [pricing](https://www.speechmatics.com/our-technology/pricing), as well as the processing cost efficiency for On-Prem customers.
