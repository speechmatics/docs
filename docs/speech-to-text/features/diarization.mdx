# Diarization

Use Speechmatics' **Diarization** to separate a transcript into distinct speakers or channels, so you can clearly see who said what.  

It’s especially useful in conversations, meetings, interviews, or multi-channel recordings where keeping track of each voice matters. By labeling speakers or channels, diarization makes transcripts easier to read, analyze, and share.

## Use cases

- **Call centers** – Identify agents and customers for training, compliance, and quality assurance.  
- **Video conferences** – Track who said what in multi-participant discussions.  
- **Medical consultations** – Capture conversations between doctors and patients with clear speaker labels.  
- **Media production** – Make multi-speaker audio easier to edit, search, and annotate.
