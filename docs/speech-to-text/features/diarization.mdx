# Diarization

**Diarization** separates a transcript into distinct speakers or channels, so you can clearly see who said what.

## Use cases

Diarization is great for when you have multiple speakers or channels and want to keep track of who is speaking across them.

Some use examples include:

- **Call centers** – Identify agents and customers for training, compliance, and quality assurance.  
- **Video conferences** – Track who said what in multi-participant discussions.  
- **Medical consultations** – Capture conversations between doctors and patients with clear speaker labels.  
- **Media production** – Make multi-speaker audio easier to edit, search, and annotate.

## Diarization modes

Speechmatics offer the following diarization modes:
