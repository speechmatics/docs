# Languages and models


### Operating points

Choose between two accuracy models when configuring your transcription session:
- **Standard** — optimized for faster turnaround with strong accuracy. Recommended when speed and efficiency are your priorities
- **Enhanced** — our highest-accuracy model with strong turnaround times. Recommended when precision is critical, and especially for complex audio (e.g. noisy environments, varied accents)

By default, the `standard` operating point is used. You can specify the `enhanced` operating point as a part of the transcription config. For example:
```json
{
  "type": "transcription",
  "transcription_config": {
    "language": "en",
    // highlight-start
    "operating_point": "enhanced"    
    // highlight-end
  }
}
```


## Transcription languages
:::info
To automatically identify the language in an audio file, use our [Language Identification](/speech-to-text/batch/language-identification) feature.

To dynamically update your system with the latest languages and features offered by Speechmatics, use our [Feature Discovery](/speech-to-text/features/feature-discovery) endpoint. 
:::

Speechmatics supports the following languages. Your ability to use any or all of the languages will depend on what languages you are contracted to use.

Speechmatics takes a global-first approach to our languages. In a single language pack, we aim to support many different accents and dialects. This simplifies your workflow when selecting which language to use, not requiring you to know which accent is being spoken in your audio upfront. With this approach we still achieve very high accuracy compared to accent-specific language packs.

## Multilingual speech-to-text

These packs are ideal when transcribing multiple languages in the same media file or stream with high accuracy. For more information on the supported languages, please refer to [Supported Language Packs](/speech-to-text/languages).

Supported multilingual packs are:

| Language Pack | Transcription config |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Arabic and English |  `{"language": "ar_en"}` |
| Malay and English |  `{"language": "en_ms"}` |
| Mandarin and English |  `{"language": "cmn_en"}` |
| Mandarin Malay Tamil and English |  `{"language": "cmn_en_ms_ta"}` |
| Spanish and English |  `{"language": "es", "domain": "bilingual-en"}` |
| Tamil and English |  `{"language": "en_ta"}` |
| Tagalog (Filipino) and English |  `{"language": "tl"}` |

Bilingual (excluding Spanish and English) example:

```json
{
  "type": "transcription",
  "transcription_config": {
    // highlight-start
    "language": "cmn_en"
    // highlight-end
  }
}
```

Bilingual Spanish and English example:

```json
{
  "type": "transcription",
  "transcription_config": {
    "language": "es",
      // highlight-start
    "domain": "bilingual-en"
    // highlight-end
  }
}
```


## Healthcare transcription
Speechmatics offers domain-specific medical transcription models which provide unparallelled accuracy for medical use cases such as ambient scribes and dictation tools.

These models are kept up to date using officially maintained data sources. This brings significant improvements in recognition of medical terminology such as names of procedures, medications, conditions, and anatomy.

Note that for languages without a medical transcription model, Speechmatics still offers industry-leading accuracy in the healthcare domain when using the general purpose `enhanced` [operating point](#operating-points). 

:::info
The medical domain-specific model must be used with the `enhanced` operating point.
:::
 
Medical domain example:
```json
{
  "type": "transcription",
  "transcription_config": {
    "language": "en",
    // highlight-start
    "operating_point": "enhanced",
    "domain": "medical"
  // highlight-end
  }
}
```
