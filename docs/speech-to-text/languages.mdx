# Languages

This page lists the range of languages supported by Speechmatics. For more information on how to use these, please refer to the guide on [Accuracy and Language](/speech-to-text/features/accuracy-language-packs)

:::info
To automatically identify the language in an audio file, use our [Language Identification](/speech-to-text/batch/language-identification) feature.

To dynamically update your system with the latest languages and features offered by Speechmatics, use our [Feature Discovery](/speech-to-text/features/feature-discovery) endpoint. 
:::

Speechmatics supports the following languages. Your ability to use any or all of the languages will depend on what languages you are contracted to use.

Speechmatics takes a global-first approach to our languages. In a single language pack, we aim to support many different accents and dialects. This simplifies your workflow when selecting which language to use, not requiring you to know which accent is being spoken in your audio upfront. With this approach we still achieve very high accuracy compared to accent-specific language packs.
