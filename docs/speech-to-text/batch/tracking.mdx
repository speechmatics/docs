# Job tracking

Tracking allows you to attach your own metadata to a job, which can be used for tracking the job through your own management workflow.

The tracking information will be returned when you [check job status](/speech-to-text/batch/check-job-status), or [get the transcript](/api-ref/batch/get-the-transcript-for-a-transcription-job) for a transcription job.

The tracking object can contain the following properties:

- `title` - The title of the job
- `reference` - The reference used on your system
- `tags` - An array of strings
- `details` - A JSON object which is defined by your system. There is currently no limit to the size of this object

For example:

```json
{
  "type": "transcription",
  "transcription_config": {
    "language": "en"
  },
  "tracking": {
    "title": "ACME Q12018 Statement",
    "reference": "/data/clients/ACME/statements/segs/2018Q1-seg8",
    "tags": [
      "quick-review",
      "segment"
    ],
    "details": {
      "user_type": "agent",
      "client": {
        "name": "ACME Corp",
        "type": "enterprise"
        },
      "seg_start": 963.201,
      "seg_end": 1091.481
    }
  }
}
```
