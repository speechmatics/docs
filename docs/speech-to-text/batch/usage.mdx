# Usage reporting

This section describes how to make requests to Speechmatics Batch SaaS to understand your usage of the service. Usage is reported as the number of jobs successfully processed in a time period, along with the total duration of the corresponding audio files.

As for other requests to Speechmatics Batch SaaS, usage is queried using an API key. Usage is returned for the account associated with the API key. When using the examples below, you should replace the API key shown with your own.

All usage is reported on a Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) calendar day basis. Note that usage for the current day (in UTC) is **not** included in the results.

Note that deleting a completed job will have no effect on reported usage.

## Requesting usage

The following request retrieves usage for all jobs from the beginning of the 1st January 2023 until the end of the 31st December 2023. More precisely, this includes all jobs completed successfully at or after 2023-01-01T00:00Z and before 2023-01-01T00:00Z.

The `since` and `until` parameters are both optional:

- If `since` is omitted, then usage is reported from the day on which the first job was successfully processed for the account.
- If `until` is omitted, then usage is reported until the end of the previous UTC day.
