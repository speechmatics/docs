# Input

:::info
This page documents audio inputs for transcription by **REST API** (a.k.a. Batch SaaS).
* For Real-time transcription, see the [Real-time Transcription input](/speech-to-text/realtime/input).
* For Flow Voice AI, see the [Flow Voice AI supported formats and limits](/voice-agents-flow/supported-formats-and-limits).

## Supported File Types

The following file formats types are supported for transcription by REST API:

- `wav`
- `mp3`
- `aac`
- `ogg`
- `mpeg`
- `amr`
- `m4a`
- `mp4`
- `flac`

The list above is exhaustive - any file format outside the list above is explicitly not supported.

Only files where the type can be determined by data inspection are supported. Raw audio formats where the codec is not embedded in the file cannot be processed in batch mode. This includes files commonly given extensions like ".raw" or ".g729" where the codec is only hinted at in the name.


## Fetch URL

If you store your digital media in cloud storage (for example AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage) you can also submit a job by providing the URL of the audio file. The configuration uses a `fetch_data` section, which looks like this:

#### Configuration example

```json
{
  "type": "transcription",
  "transcription_config": {
    "language": "en",
    "diarization": "speaker"
  },
  "fetch_data": {
    "url": "${URL}/{FILENAME}"
  }
}
```

In SaaS, fetch requests made to the URL in `fetch_data` have user agent set to `Speechmatics-API/2.0`.

#### Fetch failure

If the Speechmatics Batch SaaS is unable to retrieve audio from the specified online location, the job will fail, with a `status` of `rejected`, and no transcript will be generated. Users can now retrieve failure information by making a GET /jobs/$JOBID request, and use that to carry out diagnostic information.

If the job has failed, there will be an additional `errors` element, which will show all failure messages Speechmatics Batch SaaS encountered when carrying out the fetch request. Please note, there can be multiple failure attempts associated with one submitted job, as there is a retry mechanism in place.
