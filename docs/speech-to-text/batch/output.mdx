# Output

Transcription jobs are processed asynchronously. You can check the status of a job to see if it has been completed.


:::tip
You can also configure notifications to be sent to a webhook when a job is completed. See [Notifications](/speech-to-text/batch/notifications) for more details.

## Check single job status

If you wish to retrieve a particular job, you can do so using the job ID for up to 7 days, after which time it will be automatically deleted in accordance with our [Data Retention Policy](/speech-to-text/batch/limits#data-retention-limits).

You can make a GET request to check the status of a job as follows:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value='unix' label='Unix'>

  <CodeBlock language="bash">
    {checkJobStatusUnixSample}
  </CodeBlock>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value='windows' label='Windows'>

  <CodeBlock language="bash">
    {checkMultipleJobsStatusUnixSample}
  </CodeBlock>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The response is a JSON object containing details of the job, with the `status` field showing whether the job is still processing or not. The possible values are:

- **`running`**: The job is still processing.
- **`done`**: The job has been completed. The transcript is available for download at the [`/jobs/:jobid/transcript` endpoint](/api-ref/batch/get-the-transcript-for-a-transcription-job).
- **`rejected`**: Transcription was not possible. This will be accompanied by an error message.

An example response looks like this:

```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "job": {
    "config": {
      "notification_config": null,
      "transcription_config": {
        "additional_vocab": null,
        "channel_diarization_labels": null,
        "language": "en"
      },
      "type": "transcription"
    },
    "created_at": "2019-01-17T17:50:54.113Z",
    "data_name": "example.wav",
    "duration": 275,
    "id": "yjbmf9kqub",
    "status": "running"
  }
}
```

## Check multiple job statuses

You can retrieve the status of the 100 most recent jobs submitted in the past 7 days. This is done by making a <HTTPMethodBadge method="GET" /> request without a Job ID as follows:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value='unix' label='Unix'>

```bash
curl -L -X GET "https://asr.api.speechmatics.com/v2/jobs/" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value='windows' label='Windows'>

```powershell
curl -L -X GET "https://asr.api.speechmatics.com/v2/jobs/" `
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY"
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Note that if a job has been deleted it will not be included in the list, unless specifically requested, as described in the [API Reference](/api-ref/batch/list-all-jobs).

## Load and process the transcript

Transcripts can be loaded in the following formats: Plain text, JSON or SRT. You can request the format using the `format` query parameter. See [API reference here](/api-ref/batch/get-the-transcript-for-a-transcription-job#request)

A few useful things to know about transcript formats:

- The default format is JSON.
- Use the `format=txt` query parameter to get the transcript in plain text. Useful for quick access to the transcript.
- Use the `format=srt` query parameter to get the transcript in SRT format. Useful for displaying the transcript in a subtitle file.
- To access other data, including word timestamps, translations, and speech intelligence features, use the default JSON format.

### Transcript response schema

Below is the schema for the transcript response when using the default JSON format.

Please refer to our [API Reference](/api-ref/batch/get-the-transcript-for-a-transcription-job#responses) for further details.

<SchemaNode schema={transcriptResponseSchema.paths["/jobs/{jobid}/transcript"].get.responses["200"].schema} />
