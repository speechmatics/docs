# Chapters

Speechmatics enables you to identify distinct, continuous chapters in your audio. With just a single API call, you can quickly transcribe and extract the timings, title and summary for each chapter.

If you're new to Speechmatics, please see our guide on [Transcribing a File](/speech-to-text/batch/quickstart). Once you are set up, include the following config to enable Chapters:

```json
{
  "type": "transcription",
  "transcription_config": {
    "language": "en"
  },
  // highlight-start
  "auto_chapters_config": {}
  // highlight-end
}
```

## Example

Python client example to return Chapters for a batch file.

<CodeBlock language="python">
  {autoChaptersPythonSample}
</CodeBlock>

## Understanding the Response

Chapters' results are only available in the JSON output.

Each chapter generated will contain a start and end time of the chapter, an auto-generated title and a short summary of the chapter. 
Chapters are non-overlapping and exhaustive i.e. the chapters cover the entire audio file from start to end.

## Considerations

- Chapters works best for longer-form content. A minimum of 10 minutes of transcribed speech is recommended for best results
- Chapters works best with Speaker or Channel [Diarization](/speech-to-text/features/diarization) enabled
- Punctuation plays a significant role in the quality of the Chapters. It is therefore recommended to avoid disabling any end of sentence [punctuation](/speech-to-text/formatting#punctuation) or reducing the [punctuation sensitivity](/speech-to-text/formatting#punctuation)


## Error Responses

### Unsupported Language

If Chapters is requested for an unsupported language, the transcription process will complete. However, no Chapters will be returned, and an error message will be included in the final JSON output.

Chapters is supported for [all of Speechmatics' languages](/speech-to-text/supported-languages) except Irish, Maltese, Urdu, Bengali and Swahili.

```json
{
  "job": { ... },
  "metadata": {
    "created_at": "2023-05-26T15:01:48.412714Z",
    "type": "transcription",
    "transcription_config": {
      "language": "xx"
    },
    "auto_chapters_config": {},
    "auto_chapters_errors": [
      {"type": "unsupported_language", "message": "Auto chapters not supported for xx."}
    ],
    ...
  },
  "results": [...]
}
```

### Chapters Failed

If Chapters fails, the transcription process will complete but the Chapters will not be returned, and an error message will be included in the final JSON output.

```json
{
  "job": { ... },
  "metadata": {
    "created_at": "2023-05-26T15:01:48.412714Z",
    "type": "transcription",
    "transcription_config": {
      "language": "en"
    },
    "auto_chapters_config": {},
    "auto_chapters_errors": [
      {"type": "auto_chapters_failed", "message": "Auto Chapters failed."}
    ],
    ...
  },
  "results": [...]
}
```
