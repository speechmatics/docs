# Topics

Speechmatics enables you to detect topics from your audio. With just a single API call, you can quickly transcribe and identify key topics with the corresponding segments of audio, allowing you to tag conversations or identify trends and patterns.

If you're new to Speechmatics, please see our guide on [Transcribing a File](/speech-to-text/batch/quickstart). Once you are set up, include the following config to enable Topics:

```json
{
  "type": "transcription",
  "transcription_config": {
    "language": "en"
  },
  // highlight-start
  // You can also configure the list of topics you wish to detect. See below for more detail.
  "topic_detection_config": {} 
  // highlight-end
}
```

## Example

Python client example to detect topics in a file for Batch with the default parameters.

<CodeBlock language="python">
  {topicsPythonSample}
</CodeBlock>

## Example Response

The topics detected are only present in the JSON output.

```json
{
  "job": { ... },
  "metadata": {
    "created_at": "2023-05-26T15:01:48.412714Z",
    "type": "transcription",
    "transcription_config": {
      "language": "en"
    },
    "topic_detection_config": {}
    ...
  },
  "results": [...],
  "topics": {
    "segments": [
        {
          "text": "The National Park Service on Twitter says it expects the closures to remain in effect ...",
          "start_time": 0.80,
          "end_time": 1.72,
          "topics": [{"topic": "Events & Attractions"}],
        },
        {
          "text": "Lawmakers in Canada have voted to regulate online streaming content ...",
          "start_time": 2.06,
          "end_time": 3.40,
          "topics": [{"topic": "News & Politics"}, {"topic": "Technology & Computing"}],
        }
    ],
    "summary": {
      "overall": {
        "Business & Finance": 1,
        "Education": 0,
        "Entertainment": 0,
        "Events & Attractions": 0,
        "Food & Drink": 0,
        "News & Politics": 1,
        "Science": 0,
        "Sports": 0,
        "Technology & Computing": 1,
        "Travel": 0
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Setting List of Topics

If you have a specific list of topics you wish to detect, you can provide this information through the `topics` parameter:

```json
{
  "type": "transcription",
  "transcription_config": {
    "language": "en"
  },
  "topic_detection_config": {
    "topics": ["pricing", "deployment", "languages"]
  }
}
```

If you don't have a specific list of topics, the Topics feature will attempt to detect these default topics in the audio:

- Business & Finance
- Education
- Entertainment
- Events & Attractions
- Food & Drink
- News & Politics
- Science
- Sports
- Technology & Computing
- Travel

:::info
 A maximum of 10 topics can be provided. If more than 10 topics are provided in the `topics` list, the transcription will complete. However, no Topics will be returned, and an [error message](#too-many-topics) will be included in the final JSON output.

## Considerations

- Topics is only supported for English
- Topics supports a custom list of up to 10 topics
- Topics utilizes a large language model (LLM). This occasionally may lead to inaccuracies in the topics detected and the corresponding segments of audio and you may receive different segments when running the same file multiple times

## Error Responses

### Unsupported Language

Topics is currently only supported for English. In the event that Topics is requested for an unsupported language, the transcription process will complete. However, the Topics will not be performed, and an error message will be included in the final JSON output.

    ],
    ...
  },

```

### Topics Failed
