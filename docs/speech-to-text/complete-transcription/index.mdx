# Complete transcription

Our REST API allows you to generate complete transcriptions from audio files programatically. We also offer several additional speech intelligence features like summarization, sentiment analysis, and topic detection (see [section below](#speech-intelligence)).

The API follows an asynchronous job-processing model, allowing you to create a transcription job, view its status, and retrieve the transcription when the job is completed. You can find our [full API reference here](/api-ref/jobs/create-a-new-job).

## How to use the API

1. Make a <HTTPMethodBadge method="POST" /> request to request a transcription job using the [create a new job](/api-ref/jobs/create-a-new-job) endpoint.
1. If successful, a job will be created with the returned `id`
1. Either poll the job status until it is completed, or wait for a notification to be sent to your callback URL.
1. Once the job completes, you can retrieve the transcription by making a <HTTPMethodBadge method="GET" /> request to the job's `id`.
