# Check job status

There are three options when it comes to retrieving your transcripts:

1. Check for single job status
2. Check for multiple job statuses
3. Configure a notification callback. You can see how to do that [here](../features-other/notifications.mdx).

If you are getting started with the API, please refer to the guide on how to [Transcribe a File](./batch-guide.mdx).

## Check single job status

If you wish to retrieve a particular job, you can do so using the job ID for up to 7 days, after which time it will be automatically deleted in accordance with our [Data Retention Policy](errors-rate-limits.mdx#data-retention-limits).

You can make a GET request to check the status of a job as follows:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value='unix' label='Unix'>

```bash
# $JOB_ID is from the submit command output
curl -L -X GET "https://asr.api.speechmatics.com/v2/jobs/$JOB_ID" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value='windows' label='Windows'>

```bash
# $JOB_ID is from the submit command output
curl -L -X GET "https://asr.api.speechmatics.com/v2/jobs/$JOB_ID" `
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY"
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The response is a JSON object containing details of the job, with the `status` field showing whether the job is still processing or not. The possible values are:

- running
- done
- rejected

An example response looks like this:

```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "job": {
    "config": {
      "notification_config": null,
      "transcription_config": {
        "additional_vocab": null,
        "channel_diarization_labels": null,
        "language": "en"
      },
      "type": "transcription"
    },
    "created_at": "2019-01-17T17:50:54.113Z",
    "data_name": "example.wav",
    "duration": 275,
    "id": "yjbmf9kqub",
    "status": "running"
  }
}
```

## Check multiple job statuses

You can retrieve the status of the 100 most recent jobs submitted in the past 7 days. This is done by making a <HTTPMethodBadge method="GET" /> request without a Job ID as follows:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value='unix' label='Unix'>

```bash
curl -L -X GET "https://asr.api.speechmatics.com/v2/jobs/" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value='windows' label='Windows'>

```powershell
curl -L -X GET "https://asr.api.speechmatics.com/v2/jobs/" `
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY"
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Note that if a job has been deleted it will not be included in the list, unless specifically requested, as described in the [API Reference](/api-ref/jobs/list-all-jobs).
