# Quickstart: Transcribe a File


The quickest way to try transcribing for free is by creating a Speechmatics account and using our self-service Portal.

## Transcribe using the API

The rest of this page will show you how to use the Speechmatics REST API to transcribe an audio or video file saved on your local machine. If you want to transcribe a file that is hosted on the Web, you can use our [Fetch URL](../features-other/fetch-url.mdx) feature.

Finally, you can also learn about [On-Prem](../on-prem/containers/cpu-container.mdx) deployments by following our guides.

### Set up your API key

1. <Link href="https://portal.speechmatics.com/signup" target="_blank">Sign up to the Speechmatics portal</Link>
1. Navigate to Manage > [API Keys](https://portal.speechmatics.com/manage-access/) page in the Speechmatics On-Demand Portal.
1. Enter a name for your API key and store your API key somewhere safe.

:::info
Enterprise customers should speak to [Support](https://support.speechmatics.com) to get your API keys.

### File Transcription Examples

The examples below will help you get started by using the official Speechmatics CLI, Python and JavaScript libraries. You can of course integrate using the programming language of your choice by referring to the [Jobs API Reference](https://docs.speechmatics.com/jobsapi#tag/jobs).


<Tabs className="code-tabs" groupId="programming-language">
    <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

The Speechmatics Python library and CLI can found on [GitHub](https://github.com/speechmatics/speechmatics-python) and installed using pip:

```
pip3 install speechmatics-python
```

```cli
speechmatics config set --auth-token $API_KEY
speechmatics batch transcribe example.wav
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

The Speechmatics Python library and CLI can found on [GitHub](https://github.com/speechmatics/speechmatics-python) and installed using pip:

```
pip3 install speechmatics-python
```

```python showLineNumbers
from speechmatics.models import ConnectionSettings
from speechmatics.batch_client import BatchClient
from httpx import HTTPStatusError

API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
PATH_TO_FILE = "example.wav"
LANGUAGE = "en"

settings = ConnectionSettings(
    url="https://asr.api.speechmatics.com/v2",
    auth_token=API_KEY,

# Define transcription parameters
conf = {
    "type": "transcription",
    "transcription_config": {
        "language": LANGUAGE
    }
}

# Open the client using a context manager
with BatchClient(settings) as client:
    try:
        job_id = client.submit_job(
            audio=PATH_TO_FILE,
            transcription_config=conf,
        )
        print(f'job {job_id} submitted successfully, waiting for transcript')

        # Note that in production, you should set up notifications instead of polling.
        # Notifications are described here: https://docs.speechmatics.com/features-other/notifications
        transcript = client.wait_for_completion(job_id, transcription_format='txt')
        # To see the full output, try setting transcription_format='json-v2'.
        print(transcript)
    except HTTPStatusError as e:
        if e.response.status_code == 401:
            print('Invalid API key - Check your API_KEY at the top of the code!')
        elif e.response.status_code == 400:
            print(e.response.json()['detail'])
        else:
            raise e
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="javascript" label="Javascript">

  The Speechmatics JavaScript SDK can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/speechmatics/speechmatics-js-sdk).

  The package for interacting with the Batch API can be installed via NPM:

```
npm install @speechmatics/batch-client
```

:::tip
This library can be used in the browser and backend runtimes like NodeJS and Bun!
[Check out our examples on Github](https://github.com/speechmatics/speechmatics-js-sdk/tree/main/examples).

  Below is a basic NodeJS example transcribing a file.


```js showLineNumbers
// This example transcribes a file in NodeJS.
// For examples in other environments, see the link above

import { BatchClient } from '@speechmatics/batch-client';
import { openAsBlob } from 'node:fs';

const client = new BatchClient({ apiKey: YOUR_API_KEY, appId: 'nodeJS-example' });

console.log('Sending file for transcription...');

async function transcribeFile() {
  const blob = await openAsBlob('./example.wav');
  const file = new File([blob], 'example.wav');

  const response = await client.transcribe(
    file,
    {
      transcription_config: {
        language: 'en',
      },
    },
    'json-v2',
  );

  console.log('Transcription finished!');

  console.log(
    // Transcripts can be strings when the 'txt' format is chosen
    typeof response === 'string'
      ? response
      : response.results.map((r) => r.alternatives?.[0].content).join(' '),
  );
}

transcribeFile();
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">

```bash
API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
PATH_TO_FILE="example.wav"

curl -L -X POST "https://asr.api.speechmatics.com/v2/jobs/" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}" \
    -F data_file=@${PATH_TO_FILE} \
    -F config='{"type": "transcription","transcription_config": { "operating_point":"enhanced", "language": "en" }}'
```

Jobs will typically take less than half the audio length to process. You will need to recheck periodically until the transcript is ready. It is also possible to get the status of up to 100 jobs at once. For more information, see the [Check Job Status page](additional-info.mdx). To set up a callback when the transcript is ready, see the page on [Notifications](../features-other/notifications.mdx).

```bash
JOB_ID="JOB_ID_FROM_PREVIOUS_STEP"

curl -L -X GET "https://asr.api.speechmatics.com/v2/jobs/${JOB_ID}/transcript?format=txt" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}"
```

:::info
Note that Windows users will need to update the examples above due to differences in formatting strings and variables when compared to Mac/Unix.

### Transcript output

As well as the content itself, the transcript will include information about the job and metadata such as the transcription config that was used.

Please refer to our [API Reference](/api-ref/jobs/get-the-transcript-for-a-transcription-job#responses) for full details about the transcript contents.
