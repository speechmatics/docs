# Latency settings

Balance speed and accuracy in your Realtime transcription by adjusting latency settings.

## Configuration options

Add these parameters to your [StartRecognition](/api-ref/realtime-transcription-websocket#startrecognition) message:

```json
{
  "type": "transcription",
  "transcription_config": {
    // highlight-start
    "max_delay": 0.7,
    "max_delay_mode": "flexible",
    "enable_partials": true,
    // highlight-end
    "language": "en",
    "operating_point": "enhanced"
  }
}
```

- `max_delay`: Time in seconds (0.7-4.0, default: 4.0) between speech end and final transcript delivery
- `max_delay_mode`: Mode setting (`fixed` or `flexible`, default: `flexible`) for handling [numeral formatting](#numeral-formatting)
- `enable_partials`: Boolean (default: false) to enable [partial transcripts](#partial-transcripts) for faster feedback

## Speed vs. accuracy trade-offs

Choose the right `max_delay` setting for your use case:

| Setting | Accuracy Impact | Recommended Use Cases |
|---------|----------------|----------------------|
| 0.7-1.5s | < 5% degradation | Conversational AI, voice assistants |
| 2.0s | ~1% degradation | Live captioning, broadcast media |
| 4.0s | No degradation | Highest accuracy needs with partial transcripts |

:::warning
Lower latency settings trade some accuracy for speed. Test thoroughly with your specific audio.
:::

## Partial transcripts

Get preliminary results faster while waiting for final, more accurate transcripts.

### How partial transcripts work

- Delivered in under 500ms (vs. final transcripts at your configured `max_delay`)
- Updated continuously as more speech context becomes available
- Enabled with `enable_partials: true` in your configuration

### Limitations

  - Accuracy is typically 10-25% lower than final transcripts
  - Punctuation and capitalization may be incorrect
  - Confidence scores are not meaningful and should be ignored

## Numeral formatting

Improve transcript readability with properly formatted numbers, dates, and currencies.

### Flexible mode

When using `max_delay_mode: "flexible"` (default):
- System waits until an entity (number, date, currency) is fully spoken
- Ensures proper formatting of complex numerical expressions
- Slightly increases latency only when entities are detected 

### Fixed mode

For applications with strict latency requirements:
- Set `max_delay_mode: "fixed"` to enforce consistent timing
- System won't wait for entities to complete before returning results

:::warning
Fixed mode reduces accuracy and readability of numbers, currencies, and dates.

## Example output comparison

### Finals only (default)

With only final transcripts (default configuration):

```
(Final): I am 35.
```

### Partials with flexible mode

With `enable_partials: true` and `max_delay_mode: "flexible"`:

```
(Partial): I
(Partial): I am
(Partial): I am third
(Partial): I am 30
(Final): I am 35.
```

Note how the system corrects "30" to "35" in the final transcript.

### Partials with fixed mode

With `enable_partials: true` and `max_delay_mode: "fixed"`:

```
(Partial): I
(Final): I am
(Partial): third
(Final): 30
(Partial): five
(Final): five.
```

Final output: "I am 30 five." Note how the number isn't properly formatted.
