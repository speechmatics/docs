# Using Microphone Input

The example below will help you transcribe your voice by using the official Speechmatics Python library and CLI.

You can of course integrate with Speechmatics using our [Official JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/speechmatics/speechmatics-js-sdk), or in the programming language of your choice by referring to the [Real-Time API Reference](/api-ref/realtime-transcription-websocket.mdx).

### Setup

The Speechmatics Python library and CLI can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip3 install speechmatics-python
```

Transcribe your voice in real-time using the Speechmatics Python library. Just copy in your API key to get started!<br/><br/>

In order to use this script, you may also need to install PyAudio by running:

```bash
pip3 install pyaudio
```

:::info
  For Mac M1/M2, use the following instructions to install PyAudio:
  ```bash
  brew install portaudio
  brew link portaudio
  BREW_PREFIX=$(brew --prefix)
  CFLAGS="-I$BREW_PREFIX/include -L$BREW_PREFIX/lib" python3 -m pip install pyaudio
  ```
