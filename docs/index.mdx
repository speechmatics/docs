## What is Speechmatics?

Speechmatics is a developer platform for integrating powerful speech-to-text and conversational voice AI solutions into your applications and workflows. We handle the underlying voice technology infrastructure, so you can focus on building seamless voice experiences.

With Speechmatics, you can:

- Receive immediate and continuous text transcriptions from live audio streams or calls (real-time transcription)
- Generate complete transcripts from recorded audio files (batch transcription)
- Build voice AI agents that naturally converse with your users (Flow service).
- Choose flexible deployment options: use our managed SaaS platform or host Speechmatics APIs within your infrastructure (on-premises)
