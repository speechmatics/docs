# Quickstart

Transform text into natural sounding speech using our low latency text to speech API.

:::info Free Preview
Text to speech is currently in preview and free to use. Features and pricing may change as we continue to improve the service. We welcome your feedback to help shape the final product.
:::

## Use cases

Our text to speech API is perfect for:

- **Voice AI**: Voice assistants, chatbots, and IVR systems
- **Translation**: Realtime translation of live events or media
- **Accessibility applications**: Screen readers and assistive technologies
- **Content creation**: Podcasts, dubbing, audiobooks, and voice-overs
- **Media production**: News broadcasts and automated announcements

## Getting started

### 1. Get your API key

[Create an API key in the portal](https://portal.speechmatics.com/settings/api-keys) to access the text to speech API. Store your key securely as a managed secret.

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install requests
```

### 3. Make your first request

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key from the portal:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">
  ```bash
  curl -X POST "https://preview.tts.speechmatics.com/generate/sarah" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"text": "Welcome to the future of speech technology!"}' \
    --output output.wav
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
  <CodeBlock language="python">
    {pythonTtsQuickstart}
  </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Voices

We offer three voices you can choose from:

| Voice ID | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `sarah` | English Female (UK) |
| `theo` | English Male (UK) |
| `megan` | English Female (US) |

To use a specific voice, include the voice ID in your API endpoint:

```
https://preview.tts.speechmatics.com/generate/<voice_id>
```

We'll soon be adding more voices to our API. We'd love your feedback on what kind of voices you'd like us to add!

## Output formats

The text to speech API supports two output formats that you can specify using the `output_format` query parameter:

### `wav_16000` (default)
- **Format**: Complete WAV file with headers
- **Sample Rate**: 16 kHz
- **Bit Depth**: 16-bit signed integer
- **Channels**: Mono (single channel)
- **Usage**: `?output_format=wav_16000` (or omit parameter for default)

### `pcm_16000`
- **Format**: Raw PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) data
- **Sample Rate**: 16 kHz
- **Bit Depth**: 16-bit signed integer
- **Channels**: Mono (single channel)
- **Byte Order**: Little-endian
- **Usage**: `?output_format=pcm_16000`

:::tip
You can start consuming the generated audio as soon as it's ready. There's no need to wait for the request to complete!

## Best practices

- **Streaming audio**: You can start playing the audio before the response completes
- **Use proper punctuation**: Periods, commas, and question marks improve natural speech flow
- **Spell out abbreviations**: Write "Doctor" instead of "Dr." for clearer pronunciation
- **Spell out numbers**: Write "Twenty-five dollars" instead of "$25"
- **Batch requests**: Combine multiple short texts into longer requests when possible
- **Cache audio**: Store generated audio files to avoid repeated API calls for identical text

## Deployment

Our text to speech API can be consumed via our managed service or deployed in your own environment.
