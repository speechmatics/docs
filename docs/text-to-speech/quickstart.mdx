# Quickstart

Transform written text into high-quality, natural-sounding speech using our advanced text to speech API.

:::warning Free Beta
Text to speech is currently in free beta. Features and pricing may change as we continue to improve the service. We welcome your feedback to help shape the final product.
:::

## Use Cases

Our text to speech API is perfect for:

- **Voice AI**: Voice assistants, chatbots, and IVR systems
- **Accessibility applications**: Screen readers and assistive technologies
- **Content creation**: Podcasts, audiobooks, and voice-overs
- **E-learning platforms**: Course narration and educational content
- **Gaming**: Character voices and dynamic dialogue
- **Media production**: News broadcasts and automated announcements

## Getting Started

### 1. Get your API key

[Create an API key in the portal](https://portal.speechmatics.com/settings/api-keys) to access the Text-to-Speech API. Store your key securely as a managed secret.

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install requests numpy
```

### 3. Make your first request

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key from the portal:

<CodeBlock language="python">
  {pythonTtsQuickstart}
</CodeBlock>

## Output Format

The Text-to-Speech API returns raw PCM audio data with the following specifications:

- **Format**: Raw PCM (Pulse Code Modulation)
- **Sample Rate**: 16 kHz
- **Bit Depth**: 32-bit
- **Channels**: Mono (single channel)
- **Byte Order**: Little-endian

## Best Practices

- **Use proper punctuation**: Periods, commas, and question marks improve natural speech flow
- **Spell out abbreviations**: Write "Doctor" instead of "Dr." for clearer pronunciation
- **Batch requests**: Combine multiple short texts into longer requests when possible
- **Cache audio**: Store generated audio files to avoid repeated API calls for identical text
