## Use cases

Our text to speech API is perfect for:

- **Voice AI**: Voice assistants, chatbots, and IVR systems
- **Translation**: Realtime translation of live events or media
- **Accessibility applications**: Screen readers and assistive technologies
- **Content creation**: Podcasts, dubbing, audiobooks, and voice-overs
- **Media production**: News broadcasts and automated announcements
- **E-learning platforms**: Course narration and educational content
- **Gaming**: Character voices and dynamic dialogue

## Getting started

### 1. Get your API key

[Create an API key in the portal](https://portal.speechmatics.com/settings/api-keys) to access the Text-to-Speech API. Store your key securely as a managed secret.

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install requests numpy
```

### 3. Make your first request

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key from the portal:

<CodeBlock language="python">
  {pythonTtsQuickstart}
</CodeBlock>

## Output format

The Text-to-Speech API returns raw PCM audio data with the following specifications:

- **Format**: Raw PCM (Pulse Code Modulation)
- **Sample Rate**: 16 kHz
- **Bit Depth**: 32-bit float
- **Channels**: Mono (single channel)
- **Byte Order**: Little-endian

## Best practices

- **Use proper punctuation**: Periods, commas, and question marks improve natural speech flow
- **Spell out abbreviations**: Write "Doctor" instead of "Dr." for clearer pronunciation
- **Spell out numbers**: Write "Twenty-five dollars" instead of "$25"
- **Batch requests**: Combine multiple short texts into longer requests when possible
- **Cache audio**: Store generated audio files to avoid repeated API calls for identical text

## Deployment

Speechmatics provides flexible deployment options. You can use our managed service, host our Text-to-Speech API in your own environment or choose a hybrid approach.
