## Release notes

### 2025-01-06
- Real-time Speaker Diarization (speaker labelling) major accuracy improvements
    - These updates enhance both speaker change detection (20% better at 1 second latency) and speaker label accuracy (25% better at 1 second latency)
- New English Real-time model with faster Partials and gives a higher accuracy at low latency
    - Expect Partials to return in approximately 300ms, a notable improvement from the previous 500ms

**Impact of the Diarization updates on Your Use Case:**
- If you do not use Diarization, this change will not affect you
- If Diarization is a part of your workflow, we recommend evaluating the changes since this will now mean that more short interjections will be captured. Also, fast back-and-forth conversations will now be better represented in real-time

**Impact of the new English model on Your Use Case:**
- If you do not use Partials this change is not expected to affect you.
- If you rely on the words returned in Partials for your product and accuracy is crucial, you should re-evaluate. If this is an issue, we recommend waiting for a minimum time before you use the Partial for recent words
- If you use Partials primarily to determine if someone is still speaking, this update will enhance your product's performance since feedback will be faster

**What does this new English model mean for you?**
- **Lower-Latency Partial Responses:** The most recent spoken words will be delivered in Partials more swiftly, enhancing the overall responsiveness of our service and especially low-latency use cases such as Conversational AI
- **Accuracy Considerations:** While the latency of Partials will decrease, it is important to note that this may lead to lower accuracy for the most recent words. For example, if a user is speaking the word "thirteenth," you might initially receive "third" as a partial before the correct word is finalized. (This is not new behavior, but will happen more frequently). The accuracy of Finals for a given latency should see a small improvement



### 2024-10-04
- Faster Real-Time Transcription with More Consistent Latency
    - Fewer words are included in each Final (typically 1-2 words per final)
    - The latency for final word transcriptions is now more consistent
    - Average latency reduced by 300-400ms for a given max_delay
- Improved Partials - Partials now include numeral formatting, enhanced punctuation, and better casing

We recommend re-evaluating the best max_delay for your use case. In most cases, you can reduce the max_delay and still get the same accuracy!

### 2024-09-18
- Improved diarization accuracy, especially for low latencies
- Fixes for confidence scores, word timings and sentence breaks

### 2024-08-30
- Added support for Arabic

### 2024-07-01
Preview Mode will allow you to try out our latest improvements in real-time transcription. The main benefits are:
- Improved accuracy for low latencies beyond our already market-leading real-time transcription
- Allows for max_delay lower than the current limit of 2 seconds. Partials latency is unchanged at around 0.7 seconds
- Final transcript outputs are returned more 'smoothly', rather than returning longer chunks of text less frequently
- Partial transcripts now support numeral formatting
- Partial transcripts now support returning full punctuation , . ? ! (note: this can update when a final is received)
- Compatible with all existing config options and features
