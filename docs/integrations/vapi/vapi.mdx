# Vapi

Vapi is the developer platform for building voice AI agents. 
Vapi offers native integration with Speechmatics for real-time, highly accurate Speech-to-Text (STT) capabilities in AI voice agents. This integration is designed to handle real-world conversation complexities like background noise, diverse accents, and multiple speakers. 

## Key Features

### Native Availability: 
Speechmatics is a natively available transcriber option within the Vapi platform, simplifying the setup process for developers.

### High Accuracy & Low Latency: 
The integration provides an accurate and low-latency input layer, crucial for natural, real-time conversations with AI agents.

### Speaker Diarization: 
Speechmatics is the only transcriber on Vapi that provides speaker diarization, which identifies and labels who said what in multi-speaker scenarios.

### Flexible Deployment: 
The integration is available in the cloud via Vapi's managed SaaS, and Speechmatics also offers private cloud or on-premise deployment options for data privacy-sensitive use cases. 


## Quickstart

### Requirements
- Vapi >= 1.2
- Speechmatics Account (https://portal.speechmatics.com)

### UI Integration

The Vapi UI provides a simple way to integrate Speechmatics STT into your voice AI agent. 

1. Navigate to Assistants: In the Vapi dashboard, go to the Assistants tab.
2. Select or Create an Assistant: Choose an existing voice assistant or create a new one.
3. Open Transcriber Settings: Access the Transcriber tab or scroll down to the Transcriber module settings.
