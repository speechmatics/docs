# Pipecat

Pipecat is an open-source framework for building real-time voice and multimodal conversational agents. It orchestrates audio and video input/output, speech-to-text, large language models, and text-to-speech into a single, unified pipeline. 

SpeechmaticsSTTService enables real-time speech transcription using Speechmatics’ WebSocket API with partial and final results, speaker diarization, and end of utterance detection (VAD) for comprehensive conversation analysis.
When integrated with Pipecat, you can build real-time voice and multimodal conversational agents specifically tailored to your use case. 

## Quickstart
