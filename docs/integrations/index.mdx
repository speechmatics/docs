# Speechmatics Integrations

Integrating Speechmatics as your speech-to-text (STT) engine provides a foundational upgrade to any voice application. By ensuring the "ears" of your AI are industry-leading, you solve the most common failure point in voice bots: misunderstanding the user.

## Why Choose Speechmatics STT for your Voice AI Integrations?

Speechmatics is widely regarded as the "Gold Standard" for real-world speech recognition because it is engineered for the messiness of actual human conversation, not just sterile lab conditions.

### Unmatched Accuracy
Speechmatics is the most accurate real-time speech-to-text engine, delivering final transcripts in under one second without compromising accuracy. This balance of speed and precision is critical for voice agents that need to respond naturally to users while keeping the conversation flow intact.

### Noise Robustness using VAD
Speechmatics STT uses VAD (Voice Activity Detection) to filter out background noise (cafes, call centers, wind), ensuring your agent doesn't hallucinate words due to static.

### Global Accent & Dialect Support
With a single language pack (e.g., Global English), Speechmatics STT understands diverse accents without needing regional configuration. It supports 50+ languages globally.

### Low Latency for Real-Time Transcription
Speechmatics STT delivers transcripts in milliseconds, preventing the "awkward silence" that breaks immersion in voice bots.

### Contextual Precision
Features like Custom Dictionary allow you to teach the AI brand names, acronyms, and domain-specific jargon (e.g., medical or legal terms) to ensure 100% recognition rates on high-value keywords.

## Integration Options

Speechmatics STT can be integrated into voice AI applications on a variety of platforms, including:
    - LiveKit
    - Pipecat
    - Vapi
