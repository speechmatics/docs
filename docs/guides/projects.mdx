# Using projects

Projects allow you to isolate data across different environments or applications. API keys within one project will not be able to access the transcription results of another project.

This guide explains how to create, manage, and work with projects effectively.

## What are projects?
Projects act as organisational 'environments' for API keys, the transcriptions produced by them, as well as any Voice Agent configurations.

:::info
Some settings such as profile information, model training preference and billing details are configured at the account level.
:::

Your account will start with a default project which cannot be deleted. This ensures you always have at least one working environment. 

Your account will also be capped at 1000 projects. For use cases requiring more projects, consider using [temporary keys](../get-started/authentication#batch-transcription), or reach out to [support](https://support.speechmatics.com).


## Common use cases
* **Development workflows** - Use projects for your different environments, such as Development, Staging, and Production
* **Organisation segmentation** - Use projects to monitor usage by product line, department or businesses sub-division
* **Multi-client service providers** - For customers who resell Speechmatics' services to other businesses, use projects to provide client-specific API keys, isolate billing and usage data, and validate client-specific usage reports

## Managing and using projects

### Creating projects
After signing in to the [web portal](https://portal.speechmatics.com/):
1. Open the projects dropdown in the top navigation
1. Select Create Project
1. Enter a descriptive name
1. Click Create

### Using projects
Within the [web portal UI](https://portal.speechmatics.com/), your active project is always shown in the top navigation. To switch projects:
1. Click the project dropdown
1. Select the desired project

All relevant actions such as transcribing via the UI and managing API keys will apply to the selected project.

:::info
When [using the API](../get-started/quickstart.mdx), there is no need to explicitly specify a project, since all API keys are associated with only one project.
:::

### Managing projects
Projects can be renamed and deleted via the web portal [Settings > Projects](https://portal.speechmatics.com/settings/projects). Note that the project ID is read-only and the default project cannot be deleted.

:::warning
Deleting a project permanently removes all associated transcripts, usage history, and API keys. This action cannot be undone. 
:::

## Usage Tracking
You are able to monitor project usage via the web portal's Account Usage section. For granular insights into your usage:
1. Navigate to [Settings > Usage](https://portal.speechmatics.com/settings/usage)
1. Select a project (or All Projects) from the dropdown
1. Choose a month from the Date filter to view data
